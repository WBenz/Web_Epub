on the porch looking up at the sky. He was a broad, bandy–legged little
man with a walrus mustache, with square hands, puffed and muscled on the
palms. His eyes were a contemplative, watery gray and the hair which
protruded from under his Stetson hat was spiky and weathered. Billy was
still stuffing his shirt into his blue jeans as he stood on the porch.
He unbuckled his belt and tightened it again. The belt showed, by the
worn shiny places opposite each hole, the gradual increase of Billy’s
middle over a period of years. When he had seen to the weather, Billy
cleared each nostril by holding its mate closed with his forefinger and
blowing fiercely. Then he walked down to the barn, rubbing his hands
together. He curried and brushed two saddle horses in the stalls,
talking quietly to them all the time; and he had hardly finished when
the iron triangle started ringing at the ranch house. Billy stuck the
brush and currycomb together and laid them on the rail, and went up to
breakfast. His action had been so deliberate and yet so wasteless of
time that he came to the house while Mrs. Tiflin was still ringing the
triangle. She nodded her gray head to him and withdrew into the kitchen.
Billy Buck sat down on the steps, because he was a cow–hand, and it
wouldn’t be fitting that he should go first into the dining–room. He
heard Mr. Tiflin in the house, stamping his feet into his boots.</p><p>The high jangling note of the triangle put the boy Jody in motion. He
was only a little boy, ten years old, with hair like dusty yellow grass
and with shy polite gray eyes, and with a mouth that worked when he
thought. The triangle picked him up out of sleep. It didn’t occur to him
to disobey the harsh note. He never had: no one he knew ever had. He
brushed the tangled hair out of his eyes and skinned his nightgown off.
In a moment he was dressed—blue chambray shirt and overalls. It was
late in the summer, so of course there were no shoes to bother with. In
the kitchen he waited until his mother got from in front of the sink and
went back to the stove. Then he washed himself and brushed back his wet
hair with his fingers. His mother turned sharply on him as he left the
sink. Jody looked shyly away.</p><p>“I’ve got to cut your hair before long,” his mother said. “Breakfast’s
on the table. Go on in, so Billy can come.”</p><p>Jody sat at the long table which was covered with white oilcloth washed
through to the fabric in some places. The fried eggs lay in rows on
their platter. Jody took three eggs on his plate and followed with three
thick slices of crisp bacon. He carefully scraped a spot of blood from
one of the egg yolks.</p><p>Billy Buck clumped in. “That won’t hurt you,” Billy explained. “That’s
only a sign the rooster leaves.”</p><p>Jody’s tall stern father came in then and Jody knew from the noise on
the floor that he was wearing boots, but he looked under the table
anyway, to make sure. His father turned off the oil lamp over the table,
for plenty of morning light now came through the windows.</p><p>Jody did not ask where his father and Billy Buck were riding that day,
but he wished he might go along. His father was a disciplinarian. Jody
obeyed him in everything without questions of any kind. Now, Carl Tiflin
sat down and reached for the egg platter.</p><p>“Got the cows ready to go, Billy?” he asked.</p><p>“In the lower corral,” Billy said. “I could just as well take them in
alone.”</p><p>“Sure you could. But a man needs company. Besides your throat gets
pretty dry.” Carl Tiflin was jovial this morning.</p><p>Jody’s mother put her head in the door. “What time do you think to be
back, Carl?”</p><p>“I can’t tell. I’ve got to see some men in Salinas. Might be gone till
dark.”</p><p>The eggs and coffee and big biscuits disappeared rapidly. Jody followed
the two men out of the house. He watched them mount their horses and
drive six old milk cows out of the corral and start over the hill toward
Salinas. They were going to sell the old cows to the butcher.</p><p>When they had disappeared over the crown of the ridge Jody walked up the
hill in back of the house. The dogs trotted around the house corner
hunching their shoulders and grinning horribly with pleasure. Jody
patted their heads—Doubletree Mutt with the big thick tail and yellow
eyes, and Smasher, the shepherd, who had killed a coyote and lost an ear
in doing it. Smasher’s one good ear stood up higher than a collie’s ear
should. Billy Buck said that always happened. After the frenzied
greeting the dogs lowered their noses to the ground in a businesslike
way and went ahead, looking back now and then to make sure that the boy
was coming. They walked up through the chicken yard and saw the quail
eating with the chickens. Smasher chased the chickens a little to keep
in practice in case there should ever be sheep to herd. Jody continued
on through the large vegetable patch where the green corn was higher
than his head. The cowpumpkins were green and small yet. He went on to
the sagebrush line where the cold spring ran out of its pipe and fell
into a round wooden tub. He leaned over and drank close to the green
mossy wood where the water tasted best. Then he turned and looked back
on the ranch, on the low, whitewashed house girded with red geraniums,
and on the long bunkhouse by the cypress tree where Billy Buck lived
alone. Jody could see the great black kettle under the cypress tree.
That was where the pigs were scalded. The sun was coming over the ridge
now, glaring on the whitewash of the houses and barns, making the wet
grass blaze softly. Behind him, in the tall sagebrush, the birds were
scampering on the ground, making a great noise among the dry leaves; the
squirrels piped shrilly on the side–hills. Jody looked along at the farm
buildings. He felt an uncertainty in the air, a feeling of change and of
loss and of the gain of new and unfamiliar things. Over the hillside two
big black buzzards sailed low to the ground and their shadows slipped
smoothly and quickly ahead of them. Some animal had died in the
vicinity. Jody knew it. It might be a cow or it might be the remains of
a rabbit. The buzzards overlooked nothing. Jody hated them as all decent
things hate them, but they could not be hurt because they made away with
carrion.</p><p>After a while the boy sauntered down hill again. The dogs had long ago
given him up and gone into the brush to do things in their own way. Back
through the vegetable garden he went, and he paused for a moment to
smash a green muskmelon with his heel, but he was not happy about it. It
was a bad thing to do, he knew perfectly well. He kicked dirt over the
ruined melon to conceal it.</p><p>Back at the house his mother bent over his rough hands, inspecting his
fingers and nails. It did little good to start him clean to school for
too many things could happen on the way. She sighed over the black
cracks on his fingers, and then gave him his books and his lunch and
started him on the mile walk to school. She noticed that his mouth was
working a good deal this morning.</p><p>Jody started his journey. He filled his pockets with little pieces of
white quartz that lay in the road, and every so often he took a shot at
a bird or at some rabbit that had stayed sunning itself in the road too
long. At the crossroads over the bridge he met two friends and the three
of them walked to school together, making ridiculous strides and being
rather silly. School had just opened two weeks before. There was still a
spirit of revolt among the pupils.</p><p>It was four o’clock in the afternoon when Jody topped the hill and
looked down on the ranch again. He looked for the saddle horses, but the
corral was empty. His father was not back yet. He went slowly, then,
toward the afternoon chores. At the ranch house, he found his mother
sitting on the porch, mending socks.</p><p>“There’s two doughnuts in the kitchen for you,” she said. Jody slid to
the kitchen, and returned with half of one of the doughnuts already
eaten and his mouth full. His mother asked him what he had learned in
school that day, but she didn’t listen to his doughnut–muffled answer.
She interrupted, “Jody, tonight see you fill the wood–box clear full.
Last night you crossed the sticks and it wasn’t only about half full.
Lay the sticks flat tonight. And Jody, some of the hens are hiding eggs,
or else the dogs are eating them. Look about in the grass and see if you
can find any nests.”</p><p>Jody, still eating, went out and did his chores. He saw the quail come
down to eat with the chickens when he threw out the grain. For some
reason his father was proud to have them come. He never allowed any
shooting near the house for fear the quail might go away.</p><p>When the wood–box was full, Jody took his twenty–two rifle up to the
cold spring at the brush line. He drank again and then aimed the gun at
all manner of things, at rocks, at birds on the wing, at the big black
pig kettle under the cypress tree, but he didn’t shoot for he had no
cartridges and wouldn’t have until he was twelve. If his father had seen
him aim the rifle in the direction of the house he would have put the
cartridges off another year. Jody remembered this and did not point the
rifle down the hill again. Two years was enough to wait for cartridges.
Nearly all of his father’s presents were given with reservations which
hampered their value somewhat. It was good discipline.</p><p>The supper waited until dark for his father to return. When at last he
came in with Billy Buck, Jody could smell the delicious brandy on their
breaths. Inwardly he rejoiced, for his father sometimes talked to him
when he smelled of brandy, sometimes even told things he had done in the
wild days when he was a boy.</p><p>After supper, Jody sat by the fireplace and his shy polite eyes sought
the room corners, and he waited for his father to tell what it was he
contained, for Jody knew he had news of some sort. But he was
disappointed. His father pointed a stern finger at him.</p><p>“You’d better go to bed, Jody. I’m going to need you in the morning.”</p><p>That wasn’t so bad. Jody liked to do the things he had to do as long as
they weren’t routine things. He looked at the floor and his mouth worked
out a question before he spoke it. “What are we going to do in the
morning, kill a pig?” he asked softly.</p><p>“Never you mind. You better get to bed.”</p><p>When the door was closed behind him, Jody heard his father and Billy
Buck chuckling and he knew it was a joke of some kind. And later, when
he lay in bed, trying to make words out of the murmurs in the other
room, he heard his father protest, “But, Ruth, I didn’t give much for
him.”</p><p>Jody heard the hoot–owls hunting mice down by the barn, and he heard a
fruit tree limb tap–tapping against the house. A cow was lowing when he
went to sleep.</p><p class="center">*        *        *        *        *</p><p>When the triangle sounded in the morning, Jody dressed more quickly even
than usual. In the kitchen, while he washed his face and combed back his
hair, his mother addressed him irritably. “Don’t you go out until you
get a good breakfast in you.”</p><p>He went into the dining–room and sat at the long white table. He took a
steaming hotcake from the platter, arranged two fried eggs on it,
covered them with another hotcake and squashed the whole thing with his
fork.</p><p>His father and Billy Buck came in. Jody knew from the sound on the floor
that both of them were wearing flat–heeled shoes, but he peered under
the table to make sure. His father turned off the oil lamp, for the day
had arrived, and he looked stern and disciplinary, but Billy Buck didn’t
look at Jody at all. He avoided the shy questioning eyes of the boy and
soaked a whole piece of toast in his coffee.</p><p>Carl Tiflin said crossly, “You come with us after breakfast!”</p><p>Jody had trouble with his food then, for he felt a kind of doom in the
air. After Billy had tilted his saucer and drained the coffee which had
slopped into it, and had wiped his hands on his jeans, the two men stood
up from the table and went out into the morning light together, and Jody
respectfully followed a little behind them. He tried to keep his mind
from running ahead, tried to keep it absolutely motionless.</p><p>His mother called, “Carl! Don’t you let it keep him from school.”</p><p>They marched past the cypress, where a singletree hung from a limb to
butcher the pigs on, and past the black iron kettle, so it was not a pig
killing. The sun shone over the hill and threw long, dark shadows of the
trees and buildings. They crossed a stubble–field to shortcut to the
barn. Jody’s father unhooked the door and they went in. They had been
walking toward the sun on the way down. The barn was black as night in
contrast and warm from the hay and from the beasts. Jody’s father moved
over toward the one box stall. “Come here!” he ordered. Jody could begin
to see things now. He looked into the box stall and then stepped back
quickly.</p><p>A red pony colt was looking at him out of the stall. Its tense ears were
forward and a light of disobedience was in its eyes. Its coat was rough
and thick as an airedale’s fur and its mane was long and tangled. Jody’s
throat collapsed in on itself and cut his breath short.</p><p>“He needs a good currying,” his father said, “and if I ever hear of you
not feeding him or leaving his stall dirty, I’ll sell him off in a
minute.”</p><p>Jody couldn’t bear to look at the pony’s eyes any more. He gazed down at
his hands for a moment, and he asked very shyly, “Mine?” No one answered
him. He put his hand out toward the pony. Its gray nose came close,
sniffing loudly, and then the lips drew back and the strong teeth closed
on Jody’s fingers. The pony shook its head up and down, and seemed to
laugh with amusement. Jody regarded his bruised fingers. “Well,” he said
with pride—“Well, I guess he can bite all right.” The two men laughed,
somewhat in relief. Carl Tiflin went out of the barn and walked up a
side–hill to be by himself, for he was embarrassed, but Billy Buck
stayed. It was easier to talk to Billy Buck. Jody asked again—“Mine?”</p><p>Billy became professional in tone. “Sure! That is, if you look out for
him and break him right. I’ll show you how. He’s just a colt. You can’t
ride him for some time.”</p><p>Jody put out his bruised hand again, and this time the red pony let his
nose be rubbed. “I ought to have a carrot,” Jody said. “Where’d we get
him, Billy?”</p><p>“Bought him at a sheriff’s auction,” Billy explained. “A show went broke
in Salinas and had debts. The sheriff was selling off their stuff.”</p><p>The pony stretched out his nose and shook the forelock from his wild
eyes. Jody stroked the nose a little. He said softly, “There isn’t
a—saddle?”</p><p>Billy Buck laughed. “I’d forgot. Come along.”</p><p>In the harness room he lifted down a little saddle of red morocco
leather. “It’s just a show saddle,” Billy Buck said disparagingly. “It
isn’t practical for the brush, but it was cheap at the sale.”</p><p>Jody couldn’t trust himself to look at the saddle either, and he
couldn’t speak at all. He brushed the shining red leather with his
fingertips, and after a long time he said, “It’ll look pretty on him
though.” He thought of the grandest and prettiest things he knew. “If he
hasn’t a name already, I think I’ll call him Gabilan Mountains,” he
said.</p><p>Billy Buck knew how he felt. “It’s a pretty long name. Why don’t you
just call him Gabilan? That means hawk. That would be a fine name for
him.” Billy felt glad. “If you will collect tail hair, I might be able
to make a hair rope for you sometime. You could use it for a hackamore.”</p><p>Jody wanted to go back to the box stall. “Could I lead him to school, do
you think—to show the kids?”</p><p>But Billy shook his head. “He’s not even halter–broke yet. We had a time
getting him here. Had to almost drag him. You better be starting for
school though.”</p><p>“I’ll bring the kids to see him here this afternoon,” Jody said.</p><p>Six boys came over the hill half an hour early that afternoon, running
hard, their heads down, their forearms working, their breath whistling.
They swept by the house and cut across the stubble–field to the barn.
And then they stood self–consciously before the pony, and then they
looked at Jody with eyes in which there was a new admiration and a new
respect. Before today Jody had been a boy, dressed in overalls and a
blue shirt—quieter than most, even suspected of being a little
cowardly. And now he was different. Out of a thousand centuries they
drew the ancient admiration of the footman for the horseman. They knew
instinctively that a man on a horse is spiritually as well as physically
bigger than a man on foot. They knew that Jody had been miraculously
lifted out of equality with them, and had been placed over them. Gabilan
put his head out of the stall and sniffed them.</p><p>“Why’n’t you ride him?” the boys cried. “Why’n’t you braid his tail with
ribbons like in the fair?” “When you going to ride him?”</p><p>Jody’s courage was up. He too felt the superiority of the horseman.
“He’s not old enough. Nobody can ride him for a long time. I’m going to
train him on the long halter. Billy Buck is going to show me how.”</p><p>“Well, can’t we even lead him around a little?”</p><p>“He isn’t even halter–broke,” Jody said. He wanted to be completely
alone when he took the pony out the first time. “Come and see the
saddle.”</p><p>They were speechless at the red morocco saddle, completely shocked out
of comment. “It isn’t much use in the brush,” Jody explained. “It’ll
look pretty on him though. Maybe I’ll ride bareback when I go into the
brush.”</p><p>“How you going to rope a cow without a saddle horn?”</p><p>“Maybe I’ll get another saddle for every day. My father might want me to
help him with the stock.” He let them feel the red saddle, and showed
them the brass chain throat–latch on the bridle and the big brass
buttons at each temple where the headstall and brow band crossed. The
whole thing was too wonderful. They had to go away after a little while,
and each boy, in his mind, searched among his possessions for a bribe
worthy of offering in return for a ride on the red pony when the time
should come.</p><p>Jody was glad when they had gone. He took brush and currycomb from the
wall, took down the barrier of the box stall and stepped cautiously in.
The pony’s eyes glittered, and he edged around into kicking position.
But Jody touched him on the shoulder and rubbed his high arched neck as
he had always seen Billy Buck do, and he crooned, “So–o–o, boy,” in a
deep voice. The pony gradually relaxed his tenseness. Jody curried and
brushed until a pile of dead hair lay in the stall and until the pony’s
coat had taken on a deep red shine. Each time he finished he thought it
might have been done better. He braided the mane into a dozen little
pigtails, and he braided the forelock, and then he undid them and
brushed the hair out straight again.</p><p>Jody did not hear his mother enter the barn. She was angry when she
came, but when she looked in at the pony and at Jody working over him,
she felt a curious pride rise up in her. “Have you forgot the wood–box?”
she asked gently. “It’s not far off from dark and there’s not a stick of
wood in the house, and the chickens aren’t fed.”</p><p>Jody quickly put up his tools. “I forgot, ma’am.”</p><p>“Well, after this do your chores first. Then you won’t forget. I expect
you’ll forget lots of things now if I don’t keep an eye on you.”</p><p>“Can I have carrots from the garden for him, ma’am?”</p><p>She had to think about that. “Oh—I guess so, if you only take the big
tough ones.”</p><p>“Carrots keep the coat good,” he said, and again she felt the curious
rush of pride.</p><p class="center">*        *        *        *        *</p><p>Jody never waited for the triangle to get him out of bed after the
coming of the pony. It became his habit to creep out of bed even before
his mother was awake, to slip into his clothes and to go quietly down to
the barn to see Gabilan. In the gray quiet mornings when the land and
the brush and the houses and the trees were silver–gray and black like a
photograph negative, he stole toward the barn, past the sleeping stones
and the sleeping cypress tree. The turkeys, roosting in the tree out of
coyotes’ reach, clicked drowsily. The fields glowed with a gray
frostlike light and in the dew the tracks of rabbits and of field mice
stood out sharply. The good dogs came stiffly out of their little
houses, hackles up and deep growls in their throats. Then they caught
Jody’s scent, and their stiff tails rose up and waved a
greeting—Doubletree Mutt with the big thick tail, and Smasher, the
incipient shepherd—then went lazily back to their warm beds.</p><p>It was a strange time and a mysterious journey, to Jody—an extension of
a dream. When he first had the pony he liked to torture himself during
the trip by thinking Gabilan would not be in his stall, and worse, would
never have been there. And he had other delicious little self–induced
pains. He thought how the rats had gnawed ragged holes in the red
saddle, and how the mice had nibbled Gabilan’s tail until it was stringy
and thin. He usually ran the last little way to the barn. He unlatched
the rusty hasp of the barn door and stepped in, and no matter how
quietly he opened the door, Gabilan was always looking at him over the
barrier of the box stall and Gabilan whinnied softly and stamped his
front foot, and his eyes had big sparks of red fire in them like oakwood
embers.</p><p>Sometimes, if the work horses were to be used that day, Jody found Billy
Buck in the barn harnessing and currying. Billy stood with him and
looked long at Gabilan and he told Jody a great many things about
horses. He explained that they were terribly afraid for their feet, so
that one must make a practice of lifting the legs and patting the hoofs
and ankles to remove their terror. He told Jody how horses love
conversation. He must talk to the pony all the time, and tell him the
reasons for everything. Billy wasn’t sure a horse could understand
everything that was said to him, but it was impossible to say how much
was understood. A horse never kicked up a fuss if some one he liked
explained things to him. Billy could give examples, too. He had known,
for instance, a horse nearly dead beat with fatigue to perk up when told
it was only a little farther to his destination. And he had known a
horse paralyzed with fright to come out of it when his rider told him
what it was that was frightening him. While he talked in the mornings,
Billy Buck cut twenty or thirty straws into neat three–inch lengths and
stuck them into his hatband. Then during the whole day, if he wanted to
pick his teeth or merely to chew on something, he had only to reach up
for one of them.</p><p>Jody listened carefully, for he knew and the whole country knew that
Billy Buck was a fine hand with horses. Billy’s own horse was a stringy
cayuse with a hammer head, but he nearly always won the first prizes at
the stock trials. Billy could rope a steer, take a double half–hitch
about the horn with his riata, and dismount, and his horse would play
the steer as an angler plays a fish, keeping a tight rope until the
steer was down or beaten.</p><p>Every morning, after Jody had curried and brushed the pony, he let down
the barrier of the stall, and Gabilan thrust past him and raced down the
barn and into the corral. Around and around he galloped, and sometimes
he jumped forward and landed on stiff legs. He stood quivering, stiff
ears forward, eyes rolling so that the whites showed, pretending to be
frightened. At last he walked snorting to the water–trough and buried
his nose in the water up to the nostrils. Jody was proud then, for he
knew that was the way to judge a horse. Poor horses only touched their
lips to the water, but a fine spirited beast put his whole nose and
mouth under, and only left room to breathe.</p><p>Then Jody stood and watched the pony, and he saw things he had never
noticed about any other horse, the sleek, sliding flank muscles and the
cords of the buttocks, which flexed like a closing fist, and the shine
the sun put on the red coat. Having seen horses all his life, Jody had
never looked at them very closely before. But now he noticed the moving
ears which gave expression and even inflection of expression to the
face. The pony talked with his ears. You could tell exactly how he felt
about everything by the way his ears pointed. Sometimes they were stiff
and upright and sometimes lax and sagging. They went back when he was
angry or fearful, and forward when he was anxious and curious and
pleased; and their exact position indicated which emotion he had.</p><p>Billy Buck kept his word. In the early fall the training began. First
there was the halter–breaking, and that was the hardest because it was
the first thing. Jody held a carrot and coaxed and promised and pulled
on the rope. The pony set his feet like a burro when he felt the strain.
But before long he learned. Jody walked all over the ranch leading him.
Gradually he took to dropping the rope until the pony followed him unled
wherever he went.</p><p>And then came the training on the long halter. That was slower work.
Jody stood in the middle of a circle, holding the long halter. He
clucked with his tongue and the pony started to walk in a big circle,
held in by the long rope. He clucked again to make the pony trot, and
again to make him gallop! Around and around Gabilan went thundering and
enjoying it immensely. Then he called, “Whoa,” and the pony stopped. It
was not long until Gabilan was perfect at it. But in many ways he was a
bad pony. He bit Jody in the pants and stomped on Jody’s feet. Now and
then his ears went back and he aimed a tremendous kick at the boy. Every
time he did one of these bad things, Gabilan settled back and seemed to
laugh to himself.</p><p>Billy Buck worked at the hair rope in the evenings before the fireplace.
Jody collected tail hair in a bag, and he sat and watched Billy slowly
constructing the rope, twisting a few hairs to make a string and rolling
two strings together for a cord, and then braiding a number of cords to
make the rope. Billy rolled the finished rope on the floor under his
foot to make it round and hard.</p><p>The long halter work rapidly approached perfection. Jody’s father,
watching the pony stop and start and trot and gallop, was a little
bothered by it.</p><p>“He’s getting to be almost a trick pony,” he complained. “I don’t like
trick horses. It takes all the—dignity out of a horse to make him do
tricks. Why, a trick horse is kind of like an actor—no dignity, no
character of his own.” And his father said, “I guess you better be
getting him used to the saddle pretty soon.”</p><p>Jody rushed for the harness–room. For some time he had been riding the
saddle on a sawhorse. He changed the stirrup length over and over, and
could never get it just right. Sometimes, mounted on the sawhorse in the
harness–room, with collars and hames and tugs hung all about him, Jody
rode out beyond the room. He carried his rifle across the pommel. He saw
the fields go flying by, and he heard the beat of the galloping hoofs.</p><p class="center">*        *        *        *        *</p><p>It was a ticklish job, saddling the pony the first time. Gabilan hunched
and reared and threw the saddle off before the cinch could be tightened.
It had to be replaced again and again until at last the pony let it
stay. And the cinching was difficult, too. Day by day Jody tightened the
girth a little more until at last the pony didn’t mind the saddle at
all.</p><p>Then there was the bridle. Billy explained how to use a stick of
licorice for a bit until Gabilan was used to having something in his
mouth. Billy explained, “Of course we could force–break him to
everything, but he wouldn’t be as good a horse if we did. He’d always be
a little bit afraid, and he wouldn’t mind because he wanted to.”</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/i027.jpg" alt="Illustration"/></div><p>The first time the pony wore the bridle he whipped his head about and
worked his tongue against the bit until the blood oozed from the corners
of his mouth. He tried to rub the headstall off on the manger. His ears
pivoted about and his eyes turned red with fear and with general
rambunctiousness. Jody rejoiced, for he knew that only a mean–souled
horse does not resent training.</p><p>And Jody trembled when he thought of the time when he would first sit in
the saddle. The pony would probably throw him off. There was no disgrace
in that. The disgrace would come if he did not get right up and mount
again. Sometimes he dreamed that he lay in the dirt and cried and
couldn’t make himself mount again. The shame of the dream lasted until
the middle of the day.</p><p>Gabilan was growing fast. Already he had lost the long–leggedness of the
colt; his mane was getting longer and blacker. Under the constant
currying and brushing his coat lay as smooth and gleaming as orange–red
lacquer. Jody oiled the hoofs and kept them carefully trimmed so they
would not crack.</p><p>The hair rope was nearly finished. Jody’s father gave him an old pair of
spurs and bent in the side bars and cut down the strap and took up the
chainlets until they fitted. And then one day Carl Tiflin said:</p><p>“The pony’s growing faster than I thought. I guess you can ride him by
Thanksgiving. Think you can stick on?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Jody said shyly. Thanksgiving was only three weeks off.
He hoped it wouldn’t rain, for rain would spot the red saddle.</p><p>Gabilan knew and liked Jody by now. He nickered when Jody came across
the stubble–field, and in the pasture he came running when his master
whistled for him. There was always a carrot for him every time.</p><p>Billy Buck gave him riding instructions over and over. “Now when you get
up there, just grab tight with your knees and keep your hands away from
the saddle, and if you get throwed, don’t let that stop you. No matter
how good a man is, there’s always some horse can pitch him. You just
climb up again before he gets to feeling smart about it. Pretty soon, he
won’t throw you no more, and pretty soon he <span class="emphasis"><em>can’t</em></span> throw you no more.
That’s the way to do it.”</p><p>“I hope it don’t rain before,” Jody said.</p><p>“Why not? Don’t want to get throwed in the mud?”</p><p>That was partly it, and also he was afraid that in the flurry of bucking
Gabilan might slip and fall on him and break his leg or his hip. He had
seen that happen to men before, had seen how they writhed on the ground
like squashed bugs, and he was afraid of it.</p><p>He practiced on the sawhorse how he would hold the reins in his left
hand and a hat in his right hand. If he kept his hands thus busy, he
couldn’t grab the horn if he felt himself going off. He didn’t like to
think of what would happen if he did grab the horn. Perhaps his father
and Billy Buck would never speak to him again, they would be so ashamed.
The news would get about and his mother would be ashamed too. And in the
schoolyard—it was too awful to contemplate.</p><p>He began putting his weight in a stirrup when Gabilan was saddled, but
he didn’t throw his leg over the pony’s back. That was forbidden until
Thanksgiving.</p><p>Every afternoon he put the red saddle on the pony and cinched it tight.
The pony was learning already to fill his stomach out unnaturally large
while the cinching was going on, and then to let it down when the straps
were fixed. Sometimes Jody led him up to the brush line and let him
drink from the round green tub, and sometimes he led him up through the
stubble–field to the hilltop from which it was possible to see the white
town of Salinas and the geometric fields of the great valley, and the
oak trees clipped by the sheep. Now and then they broke through the
brush and came to little cleared circles so hedged in that the world was
gone and only the sky and the circle of brush were left from the old
life. Gabilan liked these trips and showed it by keeping his head very
high and by quivering his nostrils with interest. When the two came back
from an expedition they smelled of the sweet sage they had forced
through.</p><p class="center">*        *        *        *        *</p><p>Time dragged on toward Thanksgiving, but winter came fast. The clouds
swept down and hung all day over the land and brushed the hilltops, and
the winds blew shrilly at night. All day the dry oak leaves drifted down
from the trees until they covered the ground, and yet the trees were
unchanged.</p><p>Jody had wished it might not rain before Thanksgiving, but it did. The
brown earth turned dark and the trees glistened. The cut ends of the
stubble turned black with mildew; the hay–stacks grayed from exposure to
the damp, and on the roofs the moss, which had been all summer as gray
as lizards, turned a brilliant yellow–green. During the week of rain,
Jody kept the pony in the box stall out of the dampness, except for a
little time after school when he took him out for exercise and to drink
at the water–trough in the upper corral. Not once did Gabilan get wet.</p><p>The wet weather continued until little new grass appeared. Jody walked
to school dressed in a slicker and short rubber boots. At length one
morning the sun came out brightly. Jody, at his work in the box stall,
said to Billy Buck, “Maybe I’ll leave Gabilan in the corral when I go to
school today.”</p><p>“Be good for him to be out in the sun,” Billy assured him. “No animal
likes to be cooped up too long. Your father and me are going back on the
hill to clean the leaves out of the spring.” Billy nodded and picked his
teeth with one of his little straws.</p><p>“If the rain comes, though—” Jody suggested.</p><p>“Not likely to rain today. She’s rained herself out.” Billy pulled up
his sleeves and snapped his arm bands. “If it comes on to rain—why a
little rain don’t hurt a horse.”</p><p>“Well, if it does come to rain, you put him in, will you, Billy? I’m
scared he might get cold so I couldn’t ride him when the time comes.”</p><p>“Oh sure! I’ll watch out for him if we get back in time. But it won’t
rain today.”</p><p>And so Jody, when he went to school, left Gabilan standing out in the
corral.</p><p>Billy Buck wasn’t wrong about many things. He couldn’t be. But he was
wrong about the weather that day, for a little after noon the clouds
pushed over the hills and the rain began to pour down. Jody heard it
start on the schoolhouse roof. He considered holding up one finger for
permission to go to the outhouse and, once outside, running for home to
put the pony in. Punishment would be prompt both at school and at home.
He gave it up and took ease from Billy’s assurance that rain couldn’t
hurt a horse. When school was finally out, he hurried home through the
dark rain. The banks at the sides of the road spouted little jets of
muddy water. The rain slanted and swirled under a cold and gusty wind.
Jody dog–trotted home, slopping through the gravelly mud of the road.</p><p>From the top of the ridge he could see Gabilan standing miserably in the
corral. The red coat was almost black, and streaked with water. He stood
head down with his rump to the rain and wind. Jody arrived running and
threw open the barn door and led the wet pony in by his forelock. Then
he found a gunny sack and rubbed the soaked hair and rubbed the legs and
ankles. Gabilan stood patiently, but he trembled in gusts like the wind.</p><p>When he had dried the pony as well as he could, Jody went up to the
house and brought hot water down to the barn and soaked the grain in it.
Gabilan was not very hungry. He nibbled at the hot mash, but he was not
very much interested in it, and he still shivered now and then. A little
steam rose from his damp back.</p><p>It was almost dark when Billy Buck and Carl Tiflin came home. “When the
rain started we put up at Ben Herche’s place, and the rain never let up
all afternoon,” Carl Tiflin explained. Jody looked reproachfully at
Billy Buck and Billy felt guilty.</p><p>“You said it wouldn’t rain,” Jody accused him.</p><p>Billy looked away. “It’s hard to tell, this time of year,” he said, but
his excuse was lame. He had no right to be fallible, and he knew it.</p><p>“The pony got wet, got soaked through.”</p><p>“Did you dry him off?”</p><p>“I rubbed him with a sack and I gave him hot grain.”</p><p>Billy nodded in agreement.</p><p>“Do you think he’ll take cold, Billy?”</p><p>“A little rain never hurt anything,” Billy assured him.</p><p>Jody’s father joined the conversation then and lectured the boy a
little. “A horse,” he said, “isn’t any lap–dog kind of thing.” Carl
Tiflin hated weakness and sickness, and he held a violent contempt for
helplessness.</p><p>Jody’s mother put a platter of steaks on the table and boiled potatoes
and boiled squash, which clouded the room with their steam. They sat
down to eat. Carl Tiflin still grumbled about weakness put into animals
and men by too much coddling.</p><p>Billy Buck felt bad about his mistake. “Did you blanket him?” he asked.</p><p>“No. I couldn’t find any blanket. I laid some sacks over his back.”</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/i035.jpg" alt="Illustration"/></div><p>“We’ll go down and cover him up after we eat, then.” Billy felt better
about it then. When Jody’s father had gone in to the fire and his mother
was washing dishes, Billy found and lighted a lantern. He and Jody
walked through the mud to the barn. The barn was dark and warm, and
sweet. The horses still munched their evening hay. “You hold the
lantern!” Billy ordered. And he felt the pony’s legs and tested the heat
of the flanks. He put his cheek against the pony’s gray muzzle and then
he rolled up the eyelids to look at the eyeballs and he lifted the lips
to see the gums, and he put his fingers inside his ears. “He don’t seem
so chipper,” Billy said. “I’ll give him a rub–down.”</p><p>Then Billy found a sack and rubbed the pony’s legs violently and he
rubbed the chest and the withers. Gabilan was strangely spiritless. He
submitted patiently to the rubbing. At last Billy brought an old cotton
comforter from the saddle–room, and threw it over the pony’s back and
tied it at neck and chest with string.</p><p>“Now he’ll be all right in the morning,” Billy said.</p><p class="center">*        *        *        *        *</p><p>Jody’s mother looked up when he got back to the house. “You’re late up
from bed,” she said. She held his chin in her hard hand and brushed the
tangled hair out of his eyes and she said, “Don’t worry about the pony.
He’ll be all right. Billy’s as good as any horse doctor in the country.”</p><p>Jody hadn’t known she could see his worry. He pulled gently away from
her and knelt down in front of the fireplace until it burned his
stomach. He scorched himself through and then went in to bed, but it was
a hard thing to go to sleep. He awakened after what seemed a long time.
The room was dark but there was a grayness in the window like that which
precedes the dawn. He got up and found his overalls and searched for the
legs, and then the clock in the other room struck two. He laid his
clothes down and got back into bed. It was broad daylight when he
awakened again. For the first time he had slept through the ringing of
the triangle. He leaped up, flung on his clothes and went out of the
door still buttoning his shirt. His mother looked after him for a moment
and then went quietly back to her work. Her eyes were brooding and kind.
Now and then her mouth smiled a little but without changing her eyes at
all.</p><p>Jody ran on toward the barn. Halfway there he heard the sound he
dreaded, the hollow rasping cough of a horse. He broke into a sprint
then. In the barn he found Billy Buck with the pony. Billy was rubbing
its legs with his strong thick hands. He looked up and smiled gaily. “He
just took a little cold,” Billy said. “We’ll have him out of it in a
couple of days.”</p><p>Jody looked at the pony’s face. The eyes were half closed and the lids
thick and dry. In the eye corners a crust of hard mucus stuck. Gabilan’s
ears hung loosely sideways and his head was low. Jody put out his hand,
but the pony did not move close to it. He coughed again and his whole
body constricted with the effort. A little stream of thin fluid ran from
his nostrils.</p><p>Jody looked back at Billy Buck. “He’s awful sick, Billy.”</p><p>“Just a little cold, like I said,” Billy insisted. “You go get some
breakfast and then go back to school. I’ll take care of him.”</p><p>“But you might have to do something else. You might leave him.”</p><p>“No, I won’t. I won’t leave him at all. Tomorrow’s Saturday. Then you
can stay with him all day.” Billy had failed again, and he felt badly
about it. He had to cure the pony now.</p><p>Jody walked up to the house and took his place listlessly at the table.
The eggs and bacon were cold and greasy, but he didn’t notice it. He ate
his usual amount. He didn’t even ask to stay home from school. His
mother pushed his hair back when she took his plate. “Billy’ll take care
of the pony,” she assured him.</p><p>He moped through the whole day at school. He couldn’t answer any
questions nor read any words. He couldn’t even tell anyone the pony was
sick, for that might make him sicker. And when school was finally out he
started home in dread. He walked slowly and let the other boys leave
him. He wished he might continue walking and never arrive at the ranch.</p><p>Billy was in the barn, as he had promised, and the pony was worse. His
eyes were almost closed now, and his breath whistled shrilly past an
obstruction in his nose. A film covered that part of the eyes that was
visible at all. It was doubtful whether the pony could see any more. Now
and then he snorted, to clear his nose, and by the action seemed to plug
it tighter. Jody looked dispiritedly at the pony’s coat. The hair lay
rough and unkempt and seemed to have lost all of its old luster. Billy
stood quietly beside the stall. Jody hated to ask, but he had to know.</p><p>“Billy, is he—is he going to get well?”</p><p>Billy put his fingers between the bars under the pony’s jaw and felt
about. “Feel here,” he said and he guided Jody’s fingers to a large lump
under the jaw. “When that gets bigger, I’ll open it up and then he’ll
get better.”</p><p>Jody looked quickly away, for he had heard about that lump. “What is it
the matter with him?”</p><p>Billy didn’t want to answer, but he had to. He couldn’t be wrong three
times. “Strangles,” he said shortly, “but don’t you worry about that.
I’ll pull him out of it. I’ve seen them get well when they were worse
than Gabilan is. I’m going to steam him now. You can help.”</p><p>“Yes,” Jody said miserably. He followed Billy into the grain room and
watched him make the steaming bag ready. It was a long canvas nose bag
with straps to go over a horse’s ears. Billy filled it one–third full of
bran and then he added a couple of handfuls of dried hops. On top of the
dry substance he poured a little carbolic acid and a little turpentine.
“I’ll be mixing it all up while you run to the house for a kettle of
boiling water,” Billy said.</p><p>When Jody came back with the steaming kettle, Billy buckled the straps
over Gabilan’s head and fitted the bag tightly around his nose. Then
through a little hole in the side of the bag he poured the boiling water
on the mixture. The pony started away as a cloud of strong steam rose
up, but then the soothing fumes crept through his nose and into his
lungs, and the sharp steam began to clear out the nasal passages. He
breathed loudly. His legs trembled in an ague, and his eyes closed
against the biting cloud. Billy poured in more water and kept the steam
rising for fifteen minutes. At last he set down the kettle and took the
bag from Gabilan’s nose. The pony looked better. He breathed freely, and
his eyes were open wider than they had been.</p><p>“See how good it makes him feel,” Billy said. “Now we’ll wrap him up in
the blanket again. Maybe he’ll be nearly well by morning.”</p><p>“I’ll stay with him tonight,” Jody suggested.</p><p>“No. Don’t you do it. I’ll bring my blankets down here and put them in
the hay. You can stay tomorrow and steam him if he needs it.”</p><p>The evening was falling when they went to the house for their supper.
Jody didn’t even realize that some one else had fed the chickens and
filled the wood–box. He walked up past the house to the dark brush line
and took a drink of water from the tub. The spring water was so cold
that it stung his mouth and drove a shiver through him. The sky above
the hills was still light. He saw a hawk flying so high that it caught
the sun on its breast and shone like a spark. Two blackbirds were
driving him down the sky, glittering as they attacked their enemy. In
the west, the clouds were moving in to rain again.</p><p>Jody’s father didn’t speak at all while the family ate supper, but after
Billy Buck had taken his blankets and gone to sleep in the barn, Carl
Tiflin built a high fire in the fireplace and told stories. He told
about the wild man who ran naked through the country and had a tail and
ears like a horse, and he told about the rabbit–cats of Moro Cojo that
hopped into the trees for birds. He revived the famous Maxwell brothers
who found a vein of gold and hid the traces of it so carefully that they
could never find it again.</p><p>Jody sat with his chin in his hands; his mouth worked nervously, and his
father gradually became aware that he wasn’t listening very carefully.
“Isn’t that funny?” he asked.</p><p>Jody laughed politely and said, “Yes, sir.” His father was angry and
hurt, then. He didn’t tell any more stories. After a while, Jody took a
lantern and went down to the barn. Billy Buck was asleep in the hay,
and, except that his breath rasped a little in his lungs, the pony
seemed to be much better. Jody stayed a little while, running his
fingers over the red rough coat, and then he took up the lantern and
went back to the house. When he was in bed, his mother came into the
room.</p><p>“Have you enough covers on? It’s getting winter.”</p><p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p><p>“Well, get some rest tonight.” She hesitated to go out, stood
uncertainly. “The pony will be all right,” she said.</p><p class="center">*        *        *        *        *</p><p>Jody was tired. He went to sleep quickly and didn’t awaken until dawn.
The triangle sounded, and Billy Buck came up from the barn before Jody
could get out of the house.</p><p>“How is he?” Jody demanded.</p><p>Billy always wolfed his breakfast. “Pretty good. I’m going to open that
lump this morning. Then he’ll be better maybe.”</p><p>After breakfast, Billy got out his best knife, one with a needle point.
He whetted the shining blade a long time on a little carborundum stone.
He tried the point and the blade again and again on his calloused
thumb–ball, and at last he tried it on his upper lip.</p><p>On the way to the barn, Jody noticed how the young grass was up and how
the stubble was melting day by day into the new green crop of volunteer.
It was a cold sunny morning.</p><p>As soon as he saw the pony, Jody knew he was worse. His eyes were closed
and sealed shut with dried mucus. His head hung so low that his nose
almost touched the straw of his bed. There was a little groan in each
breath, a deep–seated, patient groan.</p><p>Billy lifted the weak head and made a quick slash with the knife. Jody
saw the yellow pus run out. He held up the head while Billy swabbed out
the wound with weak carbolic acid salve.</p><p>“Now he’ll feel better,” Billy assured him. “That yellow poison is what
makes him sick.”</p><p>Jody looked unbelieving at Billy Buck. “He’s awful sick.”</p><p>Billy thought a long time what to say. He nearly tossed off a careless
assurance, but he saved himself in time. “Yes, he’s pretty sick,” he
said at last. “I’ve seen worse ones get well. If he doesn’t get
pneumonia, we’ll pull him through. You stay with him. If he gets worse,
you can come and get me.”</p><p>For a long time after Billy went away, Jody stood beside the pony,
stroking him behind the ears. The pony didn’t flip his head the way he
had done when he was well. The groaning in his breathing was becoming
more hollow.</p><p>Doubletree Mutt looked into the barn, his big tail waving provocatively,
and Jody was so incensed at his health that he found a hard black clod
on the floor and deliberately threw it. Doubletree Mutt went yelping
away to nurse a bruised paw.</p><p>In the middle of the morning, Billy Buck came back and made another
steam bag. Jody watched to see whether the pony improved this time as he
had before. His breathing eased a little, but he did not raise his head.</p><p>The Saturday dragged on. Late in the afternoon Jody went to the house
and brought his bedding down and made up a place to sleep in the hay. He
didn’t ask permission. He knew from the way his mother looked at him
that she would let him do almost anything. That night he left a lantern
burning on a wire over the box stall. Billy had told him to rub the
pony’s legs every little while.</p><p>At nine o’clock the wind sprang up and howled around the barn. And in
spite of his worry, Jody grew sleepy. He got into his blankets and went
to sleep, but the breathy groans of the pony sounded in his dreams. And
in his sleep he heard a crashing noise which went on and on until it
awakened him. The wind was rushing through the barn. He sprang up and
looked down the lane of stalls. The barn door had blown open, and the
pony was gone.</p><p>He caught the lantern and ran outside into the gale, and he saw Gabilan
weakly shambling away into the darkness, head down, legs working slowly
and mechanically. When Jody ran up and caught him by the forelock, he
allowed himself to be led back and put into his stall. His groans were
louder, and a fierce whistling came from his nose. Jody didn’t sleep any
more then. The hissing of the pony’s breath grew louder and sharper.</p><p>He was glad when Billy Buck came in at dawn. Billy looked for a time at
the pony as though he had never seen him before. He felt the ears and
flanks. “Jody,” he said, “I’ve got to do something you won’t want to
see. You run up to the house for a while.”</p><p>Jody grabbed him fiercely by the forearm. “You’re not going to shoot
him?”</p><p>Billy patted his hand. “No, I’m going to open a little hole in his
windpipe so he can breathe. His nose is filled up. When he gets well,
we’ll put a little brass button in the hole for him to breathe through.”</p><p>Jody couldn’t have gone away if he had wanted to. It was awful to see
the red hide cut, but infinitely more terrible to know it was being cut
and not to see it. “I’ll stay right here,” he said bitterly. “You sure
you got to?”</p><p>“Yes, I’m sure. If you stay, you can hold his head. If it doesn’t make
you sick, that is.”</p><p>The fine knife came out again and was whetted again just as carefully as
it had been the first time. Jody held the pony’s head up and the throat
taut, while Billy felt up and down for the right place. Jody sobbed once
as the bright knife point disappeared into the throat. The pony plunged
weakly away and then stood still, trembling violently. The blood ran
thickly out and up the knife and across Billy’s hand and into his
shirtsleeve. The sure square hand sawed out a round hole in the flesh,
and the breath came bursting out of the hole, throwing a fine spray of
blood. With the rush of oxygen, the pony took a sudden strength. He
lashed out with his hind feet and tried to rear, but Jody held his head
down while Billy mopped the new wound with carbolic salve. It was a good
job. The blood stopped flowing and the air puffed out the hole and
sucked it in regularly with a little bubbling noise.</p><p>The rain brought in by the night wind began to fall on the barn roof.
Then the triangle rang for breakfast. “You go up and eat while I wait,”
Billy said. “We’ve got to keep this hole from plugging up.”</p><p>Jody walked slowly out of the barn. He was too dispirited to tell Billy
how the barn door had blown open and let the pony out. He emerged into
the wet gray morning and sloshed up to the house, taking a perverse
pleasure in splashing through all the puddles. His mother fed him and
put dry clothes on. She didn’t question him. She seemed to know he
couldn’t answer questions. But when he was ready to go back to the barn
she brought him a pan of steaming meal. “Give him this,” she said.</p><p>But Jody did not take the pan. He said, “He won’t eat anything,” and ran
out of the house. At the barn, Billy showed him how to fix a ball of
cotton on a stick, with which to swab out the breathing hole when it
became clogged with mucus.</p><p>Jody’s father walked into the barn and stood with them in front of the
stall. At length he turned to the boy. “Hadn’t you better come with me?
I’m going to drive over the hill.” Jody shook his head. “You better come
on, out of this,” his father insisted.</p><p>Billy turned on him angrily. “Let him alone. It’s his pony, isn’t it?”</p><p>Carl Tiflin walked away without saying another word. His feelings were
badly hurt.</p><p>All morning Jody kept the wound open and the air passing in and out
freely. At noon the pony lay wearily down on his side and stretched his
nose out.</p><p>Billy came back. “If you’re going to stay with him tonight, you better
take a little nap,” he said. Jody went absently out of the barn. The sky
had cleared to a hard thin blue. Everywhere the birds were busy with
worms that had come to the damp surface of the ground.</p><p>Jody walked to the brush line and sat on the edge of the mossy tub. He
looked down at the house and at the old bunkhouse and at the dark
cypress tree. The place was familiar, but curiously changed. It wasn’t
itself any more, but a frame for things that were happening. A cold wind
blew out of the east now, signifying that the rain was over for a little
while. At his feet Jody could see the little arms of new weeds spreading
out over the ground. In the mud about the spring were thousands of quail
tracks.</p><p>Doubletree Mutt came sideways and embarrassed up through the vegetable
patch, and Jody, remembering how he had thrown the clod, put his arm
about the dog’s neck and kissed him on his wide black nose. Doubletree
Mutt sat still, as though he knew some solemn thing was happening. His
big tail slapped the ground gravely. Jody pulled a swollen tick out of
Mutt’s neck and popped it dead between his thumb–nails. It was a nasty
thing. He washed his hands in the cold spring water.</p><p>Except for the steady swish of the wind, the farm was very quiet. Jody
knew his mother wouldn’t mind if he didn’t go in to eat his lunch. After
a little while he went slowly back to the barn. Mutt crept into his own
little house and whined softly to himself for a long time.</p><p>Billy Buck stood up from the box and surrendered the cotton swab. The
pony still lay on his side and the wound in his throat bellowsed in and
out. When Jody saw how dry and dead the hair looked, he knew at last
that there was no hope for the pony. He had seen the dead hair before on
dogs and on cows, and it was a sure sign. He sat heavily on the box and
let down the barrier of the box stall. For a long time he kept his eyes
on the moving wound, and at last he dozed, and the afternoon passed
quickly. Just before dark his mother brought a deep dish of stew and
left it for him and went away. Jody ate a little of it, and, when it was
dark, he set the lantern on the floor by the pony’s head so he could
watch the wound and keep it open. And he dozed again until the night
chill awakened him. The wind was blowing fiercely, bringing the north
cold with it. Jody brought a blanket from his bed in the hay and wrapped
himself in it. Gabilan’s breathing was quiet at last; the hole in his
throat moved gently. The owls flew through the hayloft, shrieking and
looking for mice. Jody put his hands down on his head and slept. In his
sleep he was aware that the wind had increased. He heard it slamming
about the barn.</p><p>It was daylight when he awakened. The barn door had swung open. The pony
was gone. He sprang up and ran out into the morning light.</p><p>The pony’s tracks were plain enough, dragging through the frostlike dew
on the young grass, tired tracks with little lines between them where
the hoofs had dragged. They headed for the brush line halfway up the
ridge. Jody broke into a run and followed them. The sun shone on the
sharp white quartz that stuck through the ground here and there. As he
followed the plain trail, a shadow cut across in front of him. He looked
up and saw a high circle of black buzzards, and the slowly revolving
circle dropped lower and lower. The solemn birds soon disappeared over
the ridge. Jody ran faster then, forced on by panic and rage. The trail
entered the brush at last and followed a winding route among the tall
sagebrushes.</p><p>At the top of the ridge Jody was winded. He paused, puffing noisily. The
blood pounded in his ears. Then he saw what he was looking for. Below,
in one of the little clearings in the brush lay the red pony. In the
distance, Jody could see the legs moving slowly and convulsively. And in
a circle around him stood the buzzards, waiting for the moment of death
they know so well.</p><p>Jody leaped forward and plunged down the hill. The wet ground muffled
his steps and the brush hid him. When he arrived, it was all over. The
first buzzard sat on the pony’s head and its beak had just risen
dripping with dark eye fluid. Jody plunged into the circle like a cat.
The black brotherhood arose in a cloud, but the big one on the pony’s
head was too late. As it hopped along to take off, Jody caught its wing
tip and pulled it down. It was nearly as big as he was. The free wing
crashed into his face with the force of a club, but he hung on. The
claws fastened on his leg and the wing elbows battered his head on
either side. Jody groped blindly with his free hand. His fingers found
the neck of the struggling bird. The red eyes looked into his face, calm
and fearless and fierce; the naked head turned from side to side. Then
the beak opened and vomited a stream of putrefied fluid. Jody brought up
his knee and fell on the great bird. He held the neck to the ground with
one hand while his other found a piece of sharp white quartz. The first
blow broke the beak sideways and black blood spurted from the twisted,
leathery mouth corners. He struck again and missed. The red fearless
eyes still looked at him, impersonal and unafraid and detached. He
struck again and again, until the buzzard lay dead, until its head was a
red pulp. He was still beating the dead bird when Billy Buck pulled him
off and held him tightly to calm his shaking.</p><p>Carl Tiflin wiped the blood from the boy’s face with a red bandana. Jody
was limp and quiet now. His father moved the buzzard with his toe.
“Jody,” he explained, “the buzzard didn’t kill the pony. Don’t you know
that?”</p><p>“I know it,” Jody said wearily.</p><p>It was Billy Buck who was angry. He had lifted Jody in his arms, and had
turned to carry him home. But he turned back on Carl Tiflin. “’Course he
knows it,” Billy said furiously. “Jesus Christ! man, can’t you see how
he’d feel about it?”</p></section><footer/></body></html>
