the brush–lined road toward his home ranch. Banging his knee against the
golden lard bucket he used for school lunch, he contrived a good bass
drum, while his tongue fluttered sharply against his teeth to fill in
snare drums and occasional trumpets. Some time back the other members of
the squad that walked so smartly from the school had turned into the
various little canyons and taken the wagon roads to their own home
ranches. Now Jody marched seemingly alone, with high–lifted knees and
pounding feet; but behind him there was a phantom army with great flags
and swords, silent but deadly.</p><p>The afternoon was green and gold with spring. Underneath the spread
branches of the oaks the plants grew pale and tall, and on the hills the
feed was smooth and thick. The sagebrushes shone with new silver leaves
and the oaks wore hoods of golden green. Over the hills there hung such
a green odor that the horses on the flats galloped madly, and then
stopped, wondering; lambs, and even old sheep jumped in the air
unexpectedly and landed on stiff legs, and went on eating; young clumsy
calves butted their heads together and drew back and butted again.</p><p>As the gray and silent army marched past, led by Jody, the animals
stopped their feeding and their play and watched it go by. Suddenly Jody
stopped. The gray army halted, bewildered and nervous. Jody went down on
his knees. The army stood in long uneasy ranks for a moment, and then,
with a soft sigh of sorrow, rose up in a faint gray mist and
disappeared. Jody had seen the thorny crown of a horny–toad moving under
the dust of the road. His grimy hand went out and grasped the spiked
halo and held firmly while the little beast struggled. Then Jody turned
the horny–toad over, exposing its pale gold stomach. With a gentle
forefinger he stroked the throat and chest until the horny–toad relaxed,
until its eyes closed and it lay languorous and asleep.</p><p>Jody opened his lunch pail and deposited the first game inside. He moved
on now, his knees bent slightly, his shoulders crouched; his bare feet
were wise and silent. In his right hand there was a long gray rifle. The
brush along the road stirred restively under a new and unexpected
population of gray tigers and gray bears. The hunting was very good, for
by the time Jody reached the fork of the road where the mail box stood
on a post, he had captured two more horny–toads, four little grass
lizards, a blue snake, sixteen yellow–winged grasshoppers and a brown
damp newt from under a rock. This assortment scrabbled unhappily against
the tin of the lunch bucket.</p><p>At the road fork the rifle evaporated and the tigers and bears melted
from the hillsides. Even the moist and uncomfortable creatures in the
lunch pail ceased to exist, for the little red metal flag was up on the
mail box, signifying that some postal matter was inside. Jody set his
pail on the ground and opened the letter box. There was a Montgomery
Ward catalog and a copy of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Salinas Weekly Journal</em></span>. He slammed the
box, picked up his lunch pail and trotted over the ridge and down into
the cup of the ranch. Past the barn he ran, and past the used–up
haystack and the bunkhouse and the cypress tree. He banged through the
front screen door of the ranch house calling, “Ma’am, ma’am, there’s a
catalog.”</p><p>Mrs. Tiflin was in the kitchen spooning clabbered milk into a cotton
bag. She put down her work and rinsed her hands under the tap. “Here in
the kitchen, Jody. Here I am.”</p><p>He ran in and clattered his lunch pail on the sink. “Here it is. Can I
open the catalog, ma’am?”</p><p>Mrs. Tiflin took up the spoon again and went back to her cottage cheese.
“Don’t lose it, Jody. Your father will want to see it.” She scraped the
last of the milk into the bag. “Oh, Jody, your father wants to see you
before you go to your chores.” She waved a cruising fly from the cheese
bag.</p><p>Jody closed the new catalog in alarm. “Ma’am?”</p><p>“Why don’t you ever listen? I say your father wants to see you.”</p><p>The boy laid the catalog gently on the sink board. “Do you—is it
something I did?”</p><p>Mrs. Tiflin laughed. “Always a bad conscience. What did you do?”</p><p>“Nothing, ma’am,” he said lamely. But he couldn’t remember, and besides
it was impossible to know what action might later be construed as a
crime.</p><p>His mother hung the full bag on a nail where it could drip into the
sink. “He just said he wanted to see you when you got home. He’s
somewhere down by the barn.”</p><p>Jody turned and went out the back door. Hearing his mother open the
lunch pail and then gasp with rage, a memory stabbed him and he trotted
away toward the barn, conscientiously not hearing the angry voice that
called him from the house.</p><p>Carl Tiflin and Billy Buck, the ranch–hand, stood against the lower
pasture fence. Each man rested one foot on the lowest bar and both
elbows on the top bar. They were talking slowly and aimlessly. In the
pasture half a dozen horses nibbled contentedly at the sweet grass. The
mare, Nellie, stood backed up against the gate, rubbing her buttocks on
the heavy post.</p><p>Jody sidled uneasily near. He dragged one foot to give an impression of
great innocence and nonchalance. When he arrived beside the men he put
one foot on the lowest fence rail, rested his elbows on the second bar
and looked into the pasture too.</p><p>The two men glanced sideways at him.</p><p>“I wanted to see you,” Carl said in the stern tone he reserved for
children and animals.</p><p>“Yes, sir,” said Jody guiltily.</p><p>“Billy, here, says you took good care of the pony before it died.”</p><p>No punishment was in the air. Jody grew bolder. “Yes, sir, I did.”</p><p>“Billy says you have a good patient hand with horses.”</p><p>Jody felt a sudden warm friendliness for the ranch–hand.</p><p>Billy put in, “He trained that pony as good as anybody I ever seen.”</p><p>Then Carl Tiflin came gradually to the point. “If you could have another
horse would you work for it?”</p><p>Jody shivered. “Yes, sir.”</p><p>“Well, look here, then. Billy says the best way for you to be a good
hand with horses is to raise a colt.”</p><p>“It’s the <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> good way,” Billy interrupted.</p><p>“Now, look here, Jody,” continued Carl. “Jess Taylor, up to the ridge
ranch, has a fair stallion, but it’ll cost five dollars. I’ll put up the
money, but you’ll have to work it out all summer. Will you do that?”</p><p>Jody felt that his insides were shriveling. “Yes, sir,” he said softly.</p><p>“And no complaining? And no forgetting when you’re told to do
something?”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>“Well, all right, then. Tomorrow morning you take Nellie up to the ridge
ranch and get her bred. You’ll have to take care of her, too, till she
throws the colt.”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>“You better get to the chickens and the wood now.”</p><p>Jody slid away. In passing behind Billy Buck he very nearly put out his
hand to touch the blue–jeaned legs. His shoulders swayed a little with
maturity and importance.</p><p>He went to his work with unprecedented seriousness. This night he did
not dump the can of grain to the chickens so that they had to leap over
each other and struggle to get it. No, he spread the wheat so far and so
carefully that the hens couldn’t find some of it at all. And in the
house, after listening to his mother’s despair over boys who filled
their lunch pails with slimy, suffocated reptiles, and bugs, he promised
never to do it again. Indeed, Jody felt that all such foolishness was
lost in the past. He was far too grown up ever to put horny–toads in his
lunch pail any more. He carried in so much wood and built such a high
structure with it that his mother walked in fear of an avalanche of oak.
When he was done, when he had gathered eggs that had remained hidden for
weeks, Jody walked down again past the cypress tree, and past the
bunkhouse toward the pasture. A fat warty toad that looked out at him
from under the watering trough had no emotional effect on him at all.</p><p>Carl Tiflin and Billy Buck were not in sight, but from a metallic
ringing on the other side of the barn Jody knew that Billy Buck was just
starting to milk a cow.</p><p>The other horses were eating toward the upper end of the pasture, but
Nellie continued to rub herself nervously against the post. Jody walked
slowly near, saying, “So, girl, so–o, Nellie.” The mare’s ears went back
naughtily and her lips drew away from her yellow teeth. She turned her
head around; her eyes were glazed and mad. Jody climbed to the top of
the fence and hung his feet over and looked paternally down on the mare.</p><p>The evening hovered while he sat there. Bats and nighthawks flicked
about. Billy Buck, walking toward the house carrying a full milk bucket,
saw Jody and stopped. “It’s a long time to wait,” he said gently.
“You’ll get awful tired waiting.”</p><p>“No, I won’t, Billy. How long will it be?”</p><p>“Nearly a year.”</p><p>“Well, I won’t get tired.”</p><p>The triangle at the house rang stridently. Jody climbed down from the
fence and walked to supper beside Billy Buck. He even put out his hand
and took hold of the milk bucket to help carry it.</p><p>The next morning after breakfast Carl Tiflin folded a five–dollar bill
in a piece of newspaper and pinned the package in the bib pocket of
Jody’s overalls. Billy Buck haltered the mare Nellie and led her out of
the pasture.</p><p>“Be careful now,” he warned. “Hold her up short here so she can’t bite
you. She’s crazy as a coot.”</p><p>Jody took hold of the halter leather itself and started up the hill
toward the ridge ranch with Nellie skittering and jerking behind him. In
the pasturage along the road the wild oat heads were just clearing their
scabbards. The warm morning sun shone on Jody’s back so sweetly that he
was forced to take a serious stiff–legged hop now and then in spite of
his maturity. On the fences the shiny blackbirds with red epaulets
clicked their dry call. The meadowlarks sang like water, and the wild
doves, concealed among the bursting leaves of the oaks, made a sound of
restrained grieving. In the fields the rabbits sat sunning themselves,
with only their forked ears showing above the grass heads.</p><p>After an hour of steady uphill walking, Jody turned into a narrow road
that led up a steeper hill to the ridge ranch. He could see the red roof
of the barn sticking up above the oak trees, and he could hear a dog
barking unemotionally near the house.</p><p>Suddenly Nellie jerked back and nearly freed herself. From the direction
of the barn Jody heard a shrill whistling scream and a splintering of
wood, and then a man’s voice shouting. Nellie reared and whinnied. When
Jody held to the halter rope she ran at him with bared teeth. He dropped
his hold and scuttled out of the way, into the brush. The high scream
came from the oaks again, and Nellie answered it. With hoofs battering
the ground the stallion appeared and charged down the hill trailing a
broken halter rope. His eyes glittered feverishly. His stiff, erected
nostrils were as red as flame. His black, sleek hide shone in the
sunlight. The stallion came on so fast that he couldn’t stop when he
reached the mare. Nellie’s ears went back; she whirled and kicked at him
as he went by. The stallion spun around and reared. He struck the mare
with his front hoof, and while she staggered under the blow, his teeth
raked her neck and drew an ooze of blood.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/i085.jpg" alt="Illustration"/></div><p>Instantly Nellie’s mood changed. She became coquettishly feminine. She
nibbled his arched neck with her lips. She edged around and rubbed her
shoulder against his shoulder. Jody stood half–hidden in the brush and
watched. He heard the step of a horse behind him, but before he could
turn, a hand caught him by the overall straps and lifted him off the
ground. Jess Taylor sat the boy behind him on the horse.</p><p>“You might have got killed,” he said. “Sundog’s a mean devil sometimes.
He busted his rope and went right through a gate.”</p><p>Jody sat quietly, but in a moment he cried, “He’ll hurt her, he’ll kill
her. Get him away!”</p><p>Jess chuckled. “She’ll be all right. Maybe you’d better climb off and go
up to the house for a little. You could get maybe a piece of pie up
there.”</p><p>But Jody shook his head. “She’s mine, and the colt’s going to be mine.
I’m going to raise it up.”</p><p>Jess nodded. “Yes, that’s a good thing. Carl has good sense sometimes.”</p><p>In a little while the danger was over. Jess lifted Jody down and then
caught the stallion by its broken halter rope. And he rode ahead, while
Jody followed, leading Nellie.</p><p>It was only after he had unpinned and handed over the five dollars, and
after he had eaten two pieces of pie, that Jody started for home again.
And Nellie followed docilely after him. She was so quiet that Jody
climbed on a stump and rode her most of the way home.</p><p>The five dollars his father had advanced reduced Jody to peonage for the
whole late spring and summer. When the hay was cut he drove a rake. He
led the horse that pulled on the Jackson–fork tackle, and when the baler
came he drove the circling horse that put pressure on the bales. In
addition, Carl Tiflin taught him to milk and put a cow under his care,
so that a new chore was added night and morning.</p><p>The bay mare Nellie quickly grew complacent. As she walked about the
yellowing hillsides or worked at easy tasks, her lips were curled in a
perpetual fatuous smile. She moved slowly, with the calm importance of
an empress. When she was put to a team, she pulled steadily and
unemotionally. Jody went to see her every day. He studied her with
critical eyes and saw no change whatever.</p><p>One afternoon Billy Buck leaned the many–tined manure fork against the
barn wall. He loosened his belt and tucked in his shirt–tail and
tightened the belt again. He picked one of the little straws from his
hatband and put it in the corner of his mouth. Jody, who was helping
Doubletree Mutt, the big serious dog, to dig out a gopher, straightened
up as the ranch–hand sauntered out of the barn.</p><p>“Let’s go up and have a look at Nellie,” Billy suggested.</p><p>Instantly Jody fell into step with him. Doubletree Mutt watched them
over his shoulder; then he dug furiously, growled, sounded little sharp
yelps to indicate that the gopher was practically caught. When he looked
over his shoulder again, and saw that neither Jody nor Billy was
interested, he climbed reluctantly out of the hole and followed them up
the hill.</p><p>The wild oats were ripening. Every head bent sharply under its load of
grain, and the grass was dry enough so that it made a swishing sound as
Jody and Billy stepped through it. Halfway up the hill they could see
Nellie and the iron–gray gelding, Pete, nibbling the heads from the wild
oats. When they approached, Nellie looked at them and backed her ears
and bobbed her head up and down rebelliously. Billy walked to her and
put his hand under her mane and patted her neck, until her ears came
forward again and she nibbled delicately at his shirt.</p><p>Jody asked, “Do you think she’s really going to have a colt?”</p><p>Billy rolled the lids back from the mare’s eyes with his thumb and
forefinger. He felt the lower lip and fingered the black, leathery
teats. “I wouldn’t be surprised,” he said.</p><p>“Well, she isn’t changed at all. It’s three months gone.”</p><p>Billy rubbed the mare’s flat forehead with his knuckle while she grunted
with pleasure. “I told you you’d get tired waiting. It’ll be five months
more before you can even see a sign, and it’ll be at least eights months
more before she throws the colt, about next January.”</p><p>Jody sighed deeply. “It’s a long time, isn’t it?”</p><p>“And then it’ll be about two years more before you can ride.”</p><p>Jody cried out in despair, “I’ll be grown up.”</p><p>“Yep, you’ll be an old man,” said Billy.</p><p>“What color do you think the colt’ll be?”</p><p>“Why, you can’t ever tell. The stud is black and the dam is bay. Colt
might be black or bay or gray or dappled. You can’t tell. Sometimes a
black dam might have a white colt.”</p><p>“Well, I hope it’s black, and a stallion.”</p><p>“If it’s a stallion, we’ll have to geld it. Your father wouldn’t let you
have a stallion.”</p><p>“Maybe he would,” Jody said. “I could train him not to be mean.”</p><p>Billy pursed his lips, and the little straw that had been in the corner
of his mouth rolled down to the center. “You can’t ever trust a
stallion,” he said critically. “They’re mostly fighting and making
trouble. Sometimes when they’re feeling funny they won’t work. They make
the mares uneasy and kick hell out of the geldings. Your father wouldn’t
let you keep a stallion.”</p><p>Nellie sauntered away, nibbling the drying grass. Jody skinned the grain
from a grass stem and threw the handful into the air, so that each
pointed, feathered seed sailed out like a dart. “Tell me how it’ll be,
Billy. Is it like when the cows have calves?”</p><p>“Just about. Mares are a little more sensitive. Sometimes you have to be
there to help the mare. And sometimes if it’s wrong, you have to—” he
paused.</p><p>“Have to what, Billy?”</p><p>“Have to tear the colt to pieces to get it out, or the mare’ll die.”</p><p>“But it won’t be that way this time, will it, Billy?”</p><p>“Oh, no, Nellie’s thrown good colts.”</p><p>“Can I be there, Billy? Will you be certain to call me? It’s my colt.”</p><p>“Sure, I’ll call you. Of course I will.”</p><p>“Tell me how it’ll be.”</p><p>“Why, you’ve seen the cows calving. It’s almost the same. The mare
starts groaning and stretching, and then, if it’s a good right birth,
the head and forefeet come out, and the front hoofs kick a hole just the
way the calves do. And the colt starts to breathe. It’s good to be
there, ’cause if its feet aren’t right maybe he can’t break the sac, and
then he might smother.”</p><p>Jody whipped his leg with a bunch of grass. “We’ll have to be there,
then, won’t we?”</p><p>“Oh, we’ll be there, all right.”</p><p>They turned and walked slowly down the hill toward the barn. Jody was
tortured with a thing he had to say, although he didn’t want to.
“Billy,” he began miserably, “Billy, you won’t let anything happen to
the colt, will you?”</p><p>And Billy knew he was thinking of the red pony, Gabilan, and of how it
died of strangles. Billy knew he had been infallible before that, and
now he was capable of failure. This knowledge made Billy much less sure
of himself than he had been. “I can’t tell,” he said roughly. “All sorts
of things might happen, and they wouldn’t be my fault. I can’t do
everything.” He felt badly about his lost prestige, and so he said,
meanly, “I’ll do everything I know, but I won’t promise anything.
Nellie’s a good mare. She’s thrown good colts before. She ought to this
time.” And he walked away from Jody and went into the saddle–room beside
the barn, for his feelings were hurt.</p><p class="center">*        *        *        *        *</p><p>Jody traveled often to the brush line behind the house. A rusty iron
pipe ran a thin stream of spring water into an old green tub. Where the
water spilled over and sank into the ground there was a patch of
perpetually green grass. Even when the hills were brown and baked in the
summer that little patch was green. The water whined softly into the
trough all the year round. This place had grown to be a center–point for
Jody. When he had been punished the cool green grass and the singing
water soothed him. When he had been mean the biting acid of meanness
left him at the brush line. When he sat in the grass and listened to the
purling stream, the barriers set up in his mind by the stern day went
down to ruin.</p><p>On the other hand, the black cypress tree by the bunkhouse was as
repulsive as the water–tub was dear; for to this tree all the pigs came,
sooner or later, to be slaughtered. Pig killing was fascinating, with
the screaming and the blood, but it made Jody’s heart beat so fast that
it hurt him. After the pigs were scalded in the big iron tripod kettle
and their skins were scraped and white, Jody had to go to the water–tub
to sit in the grass until his heart grew quiet. The water–tub and the
black cypress were opposites and enemies.</p><p>When Billy left him and walked angrily away, Jody turned up toward the
house. He thought of Nellie as he walked, and of the little colt. Then
suddenly he saw that he was under the black cypress, under the very
singletree where the pigs were hung. He brushed his dry–grass hair off
his forehead and hurried on. It seemed to him an unlucky thing to be
thinking of his colt in the very slaughter place, especially after what
Billy had said. To counteract any evil result of that bad conjunction he
walked quickly past the ranch house, through the chicken yard, through
the vegetable patch, until he came at last to the brush line.</p><p>He sat down in the green grass. The trilling water sounded in his ears.
He looked over the farm buildings and across at the round hills, rich
and yellow with grain. He could see Nellie feeding on the slope. As
usual the water place eliminated time and distance. Jody saw a black,
long–legged colt, butting against Nellie’s flanks, demanding milk. And
then he saw himself breaking a large colt to halter. All in a few
moments the colt grew to be a magnificent animal, deep of chest, with a
neck as high and arched as a sea–horse’s neck, with a tail that tongued
and rippled like black flame. This horse was terrible to everyone but
Jody. In the schoolyard the boys begged rides, and Jody smilingly
agreed. But no sooner were they mounted than the black demon pitched
them off. Why, that was his name, Black Demon! For a moment the trilling
water and the grass and the sunshine came back, and then …</p><p>Sometimes in the night the ranch people, safe in their beds, heard a
roar of hoofs go by. They said, “It’s Jody, on Demon. He’s helping out
the sheriff again.” And then …</p><p>The golden dust filled the air in the arena at the Salinas Rodeo. The
announcer called the roping contests. When Jody rode the black horse to
the starting chute the other contestants shrugged and gave up first
place, for it was well known that Jody and Demon could rope and throw
and tie a steer a great deal quicker than any roping team of two men
could. Jody was not a boy any more, and Demon was not a horse. The two
together were one glorious individual. And then …</p><p>The President wrote a letter and asked them to help catch a bandit in
Washington. Jody settled himself comfortably in the grass. The little
stream of water whined into the mossy tub.</p><p class="center">*        *        *        *        *</p><p>The year passed slowly on. Time after time Jody gave up his colt for
lost. No change had taken place in Nellie. Carl Tiflin still drove her
to a light cart, and she pulled on a hay rake and worked the
Jackson–ford tackle when the hay was being put into the barn.</p><p>The summer passed, and the warm bright autumn. And then the frantic
morning winds began to twist along the ground, and a chill came into the
air, and the poison oak turned red. One morning in September, when he
had finished his breakfast, Jody’s mother called him into the kitchen.
She was pouring boiling water into a bucket full of dry midlings and
stirring the materials to a steaming paste.</p><p>“Yes, ma’am?” Jody asked.</p><p>“Watch how I do it. You’ll have to do it after this every other
morning.”</p><p>“Well, what is it?”</p><p>“Why, it’s warm mash for Nellie. It’ll keep her in good shape.”</p><p>Judy rubbed his forehead with a knuckle. “Is she all right?” he asked
timidly.</p><p>Mrs. Tiflin put down the kettle and stirred the mash with a wooden
paddle. “Of course she’s all right, only you’ve got to take better care
of her from now on. Here, take this breakfast out to her!”</p><p>Jody seized the bucket and ran, down past the bunkhouse, past the barn,
with the heavy bucket banging against his knees. He found Nellie playing
with the water in the trough, pushing waves and tossing her head so that
the water slopped out on the ground.</p><p>Jody climbed the fence and set the bucket of steaming mash beside her.
Then he stepped back to look at her. And she was changed. Her stomach
was swollen. When she moved, her feet touched the ground gently. She
buried her nose in the bucket and gobbled the hot breakfast. And when
she had finished and had pushed the bucket around the ground with her
nose a little, she stepped quietly over to Jody and rubbed her cheek
against him.</p><p>Billy Buck came out of the saddle–room and walked over. “Starts fast
when it starts, doesn’t it?”</p><p>“Did it come all at once?”</p><p>“Oh, no, you just stopped looking for a while.” He pulled her head
around toward Jody. “She’s goin’ to be nice, too. See how nice her eyes
are! Some mares get mean, but when they turn nice, they just love
everything.” Nellie slipped her head under Billy’s arm and rubbed her
neck up and down between his arm and his side. “You better treat her
awful nice now,” Billy said.</p><p>“How long will it be?” Jody demanded breathlessly.</p><p>The man counted in whispers on his fingers. “About three months,” he
said aloud. “You can’t tell exactly. Sometimes it’s eleven months to the
day, but it might be two weeks early, or a month late, without hurting
anything.”</p><p>Jody looked hard at the ground. “Billy,” he began nervously, “Billy,
you’ll call me when it’s getting born, won’t you? You’ll let me be
there, won’t you?”</p><p>Billy bit the tip of Nellie’s ear with his front teeth. “Carl says he
wants you to start right at the start. That’s the only way to learn.
Nobody can tell you anything. Like my old man did with me about the
saddle blanket. He was a government packer when I was your size, and I
helped him some. One day I left a wrinkle in my saddle blanket and made
a saddle–sore. My old man didn’t give me hell at all. But the next
morning he saddled me up with a forty–pound stock saddle. I had to lead
my horse and carry that saddle over a whole damn mountain in the sun. It
darn near killed me, but I never left no wrinkles in a blanket again. I
couldn’t. I never in my life since then put on a blanket but I felt that
saddle on my back.”</p><p>Jody reached up a hand and took hold of Nellie’s mane. “You’ll tell me
what to do about everything, won’t you? I guess you know everything
about horses, don’t you?”</p><p>Billy laughed. “Why I’m half horse myself, you see,” he said. “My ma
died when I was born, and being my old man was a government packer in
the mountains, and no cows around most of the time, why he just gave me
mostly mare’s milk.” He continued seriously, “And horses know that.
Don’t you know it, Nellie?”</p><p>The mare turned her head and looked full into his eyes for a moment, and
this is a thing horses practically never do. Billy was proud and sure of
himself now. He boasted a little. “I’ll see you get a good colt. I’ll
start you right. And if you do like I say, you’ll have the best horse in
the county.”</p><p>That made Jody feel warm and proud, too; so proud that when he went back
to the house he bowed his legs and swayed his shoulders as horsemen do.
And he whispered, “Whoa, you Black Demon, you! Steady down there and
keep your feet on the ground.”</p><p>The winter fell sharply. A few preliminary gusty showers, and then a
strong steady rain. The hills lost their straw color and blackened under
the water, and the winter streams scrambled noisily down the canyons.
The mushrooms and puff–balls popped up and the new grass started before
Christmas.</p><p>But this year Christmas was not the central day to Jody. Some
undetermined time in January had become the axis day around which the
months swung. When the rains fell, he put Nellie in a box stall and fed
her warm food every morning and curried her and brushed her.</p><p>The mare was swelling so greatly that Jody became alarmed. “She’ll pop
wide open,” he said to Billy.</p><p>Billy laid his strong square hand against Nellie’s swollen abdomen.
“Feel here,” he said quietly. “You can feel it move. I guess it would
surprise you if there were twin colts.”</p><p>“You don’t think so?” Jody cried. “You don’t think it will be twins, do
you, Billy?”</p><p>“No, I don’t, but it does happen, sometimes.”</p><p>During the first two weeks of January it rained steadily. Jody spent
most of his time, when he wasn’t in school, in the box stall with
Nellie. Twenty times a day he put his hand on her stomach to feel the
colt move. Nellie became more and more gentle and friendly to him. She
rubbed her nose on him. She whinnied softly when he walked into the
barn.</p><p>Carl Tiflin came to the barn with Jody one day. He looked admiringly at
the groomed bay coat; and he felt the firm flesh over ribs and
shoulders. “You’ve done a good job,” he said to Jody. And this was the
greatest praise he knew how to give. Jody was tight with pride for hours
afterward.</p><p>The fifteenth of January came, and the colt was not born. And the
twentieth came; a lump of fear began to form in Jody’s stomach. “Is it
all right?” he demanded of Billy.</p><p>“Oh, sure.”</p><p>And again, “Are you sure it’s going to be all right?”</p><p>Billy stroked the mare’s neck. She swayed her head uneasily. “I told you
it wasn’t always the same time, Jody. You just have to wait.”</p><p>When the end of the month arrived with no birth, Jody grew frantic.
Nellie was so big that her breath came heavily, and her ears were close
together and straight up, as though her head ached. Jody’s sleep grew
restless, and his dreams confused.</p><p>On the night of the second of February he awakened crying. His mother
called to him, “Jody, you’re dreaming. Wake up and start over again.”</p><p>But Jody was filled with terror and desolation. He lay quietly a few
moments, waiting for his mother to go back to sleep, and then he slipped
his clothes on, and crept out in his bare feet.</p><p>The night was black and thick. A little misting rain fell. The cypress
tree and the bunkhouse loomed and then dropped back into the mist. The
barn door screeched as he opened it, a thing it never did in the
daytime. Jody went to the rack and found a lantern and a tin box of
matches. He lighted the wick and walked down the long straw–covered
aisle to Nellie’s stall. She was standing up. Her whole body weaved from
side to side. Jody called to her, “So, Nellie, so–o, Nellie,” but she
did not stop her swaying nor look around. When he stepped into the stall
and touched her on the shoulder she shivered under his hand. Then Billy
Buck’s voice came from the hayloft right above the stall.</p><p>“Jody, what are you doing?”</p><p>Jody started back and turned miserable eyes up toward the nest where
Billy was lying in the hay. “Is she all right, do you think?”</p><p>“Why sure, I think so.”</p><p>“You won’t let anything happen, Billy, you’re sure you won’t?”</p><p>Billy growled down at him, “I told you I’d call you, and I will. Now you
get back to bed and stop worrying that mare. She’s got enough to do
without you worrying her.”</p><p>Jody cringed, for he had never heard Billy speak in such a tone. “I only
thought I’d come and see,” he said. “I woke up.”</p><p>Billy softened a little then. “Well, you get to bed. I don’t want you
bothering her. I told you I’d get you a good colt. Get along now.”</p><p>Jody walked slowly out of the barn. He blew out the lantern and set it
in the rack. The blackness of the night, and the chilled mist struck him
and enfolded him. He wished he believed everything Billy said as he had
before the pony died. It was a moment before his eyes, blinded by the
feeble lantern–flame, could make any form of the darkness. The damp
ground chilled his bare feet. At the cypress tree the roosting turkeys
chattered a little in alarm, and the two good dogs responded to their
duty and came charging out, barking to frighten away the coyotes they
thought were prowling under the tree.</p><p>As he crept through the kitchen, Jody stumbled over a chair. Carl called
from his bedroom, “Who’s there? What’s the matter there?”</p><p>And Mrs. Tiflin said sleepily, “What’s the matter, Carl?”</p><p>The next second Carl came out of the bedroom carrying a candle, and
found Jody before he could get into bed. “What are you doing out?”</p><p>Jody turned shyly away. “I was down to see the mare.”</p><p>For a moment anger at being awakened fought with approval in Jody’s
father. “Listen,” he said, finally, “there’s not a man in this country
that knows more about colts than Billy. You leave it to him.”</p><p>Words burst out of Jody’s mouth. “But the pony died—”</p><p>“Don’t you go blaming that on him,” Carl said sternly. “If Billy can’t
save a horse, it can’t be saved.”</p><p>Mrs. Tiflin called, “Make him clean his feet and go to bed, Carl. He’ll
be sleepy all day tomorrow.”</p><p>It seemed to Jody that he had just closed his eyes to try to go to sleep
when he was shaken violently by the shoulder. Billy Buck stood beside
him, holding a lantern in his hand. “Get up,” he said. “Hurry up.” He
turned and walked quickly out of the room.</p><p>Mrs. Tiflin called, “What’s the matter? Is that you, Billy?”</p><p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p><p>“Is Nellie ready?”</p><p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p><p>“All right, I’ll get up and heat some water in case you need it.”</p><p>Jody jumped into his clothes so quickly that he was out the back door
before Billy’s swinging lantern was halfway to the barn. There was a rim
of dawn on the mountain–tops, but no light had penetrated into the cup
of the ranch yet. Jody ran frantically after the lantern and caught up
to Billy just as he reached the barn. Billy hung the lantern to a nail
on the stall–side and took off his blue denim coat. Jody saw that he
wore only a sleeveless shirt under it.</p><p>Nellie was standing rigid and stiff. While they watched, she crouched.
Her whole body was wrung with a spasm. The spasm passed. But in a few
moments it started over again, and passed.</p><p>Billy muttered nervously, “There’s something wrong.” His bare hand
disappeared. “Oh, Jesus,” he said. “It’s wrong.”</p><p>The spasm came again, and this time Billy strained, and the muscles
stood out on his arm and shoulder. He heaved strongly, his forehead
beaded with perspiration. Nellie cried with pain. Billy was muttering,
“It’s wrong. I can’t turn it. It’s way wrong. It’s turned all around
wrong.”</p><p>He glared wildly toward Jody. And then his fingers made a careful,
careful diagnosis. His cheeks were growing tight and gray. He looked for
a long questioning minute at Jody standing back of the stall. Then Billy
stepped to the rack under the manure window and picked up a horseshoe
hammer with his wet right hand.</p><p>“Go outside, Jody,” he said.</p><p>The boy stood still and stared dully at him.</p><p>“Go outside, I tell you. It’ll be too late.”</p><p>Jody didn’t move.</p><p>Then Billy walked quickly to Nellie’s head. He cried, “Turn your face
away, damn you, turn your face.”</p><p>This time Jody obeyed. His head turned sideways. He heard Billy
whispering hoarsely in the stall. And then he heard a hollow crunch of
bone. Nellie chuckled shrilly. Jody looked back in time to see the
hammer rise and fall again on the flat forehead. Then Nellie fell
heavily to her side and quivered for a moment.</p><p>Billy jumped to the swollen stomach; his big pocketknife was in his
hand. He lifted the skin and drove the knife in. He sawed and ripped at
the tough belly. The air filled with the sick odor of warm living
entrails. The other horses reared back against their halter chains and
squealed and kicked.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/i103.jpg" alt="Illustration"/></div><p>Billy dropped the knife. Both of his arms plunged into the terrible
ragged hole and dragged out a big, white, dripping bundle. His teeth
tore a hole in the covering. A little black head appeared through the
tear, and little slick, wet ears. A gurgling breath was drawn, and then
another. Billy shucked off the sac and found his knife and cut the
string. For a moment he held the little black colt in his arms and
looked at it. And then he walked slowly over and laid it in the straw at
Jody’s feet.</p><p>Billy’s face and arms and chest were dripping red. His body shivered and
his teeth chattered. His voice was gone; he spoke in a throaty whisper.
“There’s your colt. I promised. And there it is. I had to do it—had
to.” He stopped and looked over his shoulder into the box stall. “Go get
hot water and a sponge,” he whispered. “Wash him and dry him the way his
mother would. You’ll have to feed him by hand. But there’s your colt,
the way I promised.”</p><p>Jody stared stupidly at the wet, panting foal. It stretched out its chin
and tried to raise its head. Its blank eyes were navy blue.</p><p>“God damn you,” Billy shouted, “will you go now for the water? <span class="emphasis"><em>Will you
go?</em></span>”</p><p>Then Jody turned and trotted out of the barn into the dawn. He ached
from his throat to his stomach. His legs were stiff and heavy. He tried
to be glad because of the colt, but the bloody face, and the haunted,
tired eyes of Billy Buck hung in the air ahead of him.</p></section><footer/></body></html>
