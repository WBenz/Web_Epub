last of the old year’s haystack and pitched small forkfuls over the wire
fence to a few mildly interested cattle. High in the air small clouds
like puffs of cannon smoke were driven eastward by the March wind. The
wind could be heard whishing in the brush on the ridge crests, but no
breath of it penetrated down into the ranch–cup.</p><p>The little boy, Jody, emerged from the house eating a thick piece of
buttered bread. He saw Billy working on the last of the haystack. Jody
tramped down scuffling his shoes in a way he had been told was
destructive to good shoe–leather. A flock of white pigeons flew out of
the black cypress tree as Jody passed, and circled the tree and landed
again. A half–grown tortoiseshell cat leaped from the bunkhouse porch,
galloped on stiff legs across the road, whirled and galloped back again.
Jody picked up a stone to help the game along, but he was too late, for
the cat was under the porch before the stone could be discharged. He
threw the stone into the cypress tree and started the white pigeons on
another whirling flight.</p><p>Arriving at the used–up haystack, the boy leaned against the barbed wire
fence. “Will that be all of it, do you think?” he asked.</p><p>The middle–aged ranch–hand stopped his careful raking and stuck his fork
into the ground. He took off his black hat and smoothed down his hair.
“Nothing left of it that isn’t soggy from ground moisture,” he said. He
replaced his hat and rubbed his dry leathery hands together.</p><p>“Ought to be plenty mice,” Jody suggested.</p><p>“Lousy with them,” said Billy. “Just crawling with mice.”</p><p>“Well, maybe, when you get all through, I could call the dogs and hunt
the mice.”</p><p>“Sure, I guess you could,” said Billy Buck. He lifted a forkful of the
damp ground–hay and threw it into the air. Instantly three mice leaped
out and burrowed frantically under the hay again.</p><p>Jody sighed with satisfaction. Those plump, sleek, arrogant mice were
doomed. For eight months they had lived and multiplied in the haystack.
They had been immune from cats, from traps, from poison and from Jody.
They had grown smug in their security, overbearing and fat. Now the time
of disaster had come; they would not survive another day.</p><p>Billy looked up at the top of the hills that surrounded the ranch.
“Maybe you better ask your father before you do it,” he suggested.</p><p>“Well, where is he? I’ll ask him now.”</p><p>“He rode up to the ridge ranch after dinner. He’ll be back pretty soon.”</p><p>Jody slumped against the fence post. “I don’t think he’d care.”</p><p>As Billy went back to his work he said ominously, “You’d better ask him
anyway. You know how he is.”</p><p>Jody did know. His father, Carl Tiflin, insisted upon giving permission
for anything that was done on the ranch, whether it was important or
not. Jody sagged farther against the post until he was sitting on the
ground. He looked up at the little puffs of wind–driven cloud. “Is it
like to rain, Billy?”</p><p>“It might. The wind’s good for it, but not strong enough.”</p><p>“Well, I hope it don’t rain until after I kill those damn mice.” He
looked over his shoulder to see whether Billy had noticed the mature
profanity. Billy worked on without comment.</p><p>Jody turned back and looked at the side–hill where the road from the
outside world came down. The hill was washed with lean March sunshine.
Silver thistles, blue lupins and a few poppies bloomed among the
sagebushes. Halfway up the hill Jody could see Doubletree Mutt, the
black dog, digging in a squirrel hole. He paddled for a while and then
paused to kick bursts of dirt out between his hind legs, and he dug with
an earnestness which belied the knowledge he must have had that no dog
had ever caught a squirrel by digging in a hole.</p><p>Suddenly, while Jody watched, the black dog stiffened, and backed out of
the hole and looked up the hill toward the cleft in the ridge where the
road came through. Jody looked up too. For a moment Carl Tiflin on
horseback stood out against the pale sky and then he moved down the road
toward the house. He carried something white in his hand.</p><p>The boy started to his feet. “He’s got a letter,” Jody cried. He trotted
away toward the ranch house, for the letter would probably be read aloud
and he wanted to be there. He reached the house before his father did,
and ran in. He heard Carl dismount from his creaking saddle and slap the
horse on the side to send it to the barn where Billy would unsaddle it
and turn it out.</p><p>Jody ran into the kitchen. “We got a letter!” he cried.</p><p>His mother looked up from a pan of beans. “Who has?”</p><p>“Father has. I saw it in his hand.”</p><p>Carl strode into the kitchen then, and Jody’s mother asked, “Who’s the
letter from, Carl?”</p><p>He frowned quickly. “How did you know there was a letter?”</p><p>She nodded her head in the boy’s direction. “Big–Britches Jody told me.”</p><p>Jody was embarrassed.</p><p>His father looked down at him contemptuously. “He is getting to be a
Big–Britches,” Carl said. “He’s minding everybody’s business but his
own. Got his big nose into everything.”</p><p>Mrs. Tiflin relented a little. “Well, he hasn’t enough to keep him busy.
Who’s the letter from?”</p><p>Carl still frowned on Jody. “I’ll keep him busy if he isn’t careful.” He
held out a sealed letter. “I guess it’s from your father.”</p><p>Mrs. Tiflin took a hairpin from her head and slit open the flap. Her
lips pursed judiciously. Jody saw her eyes snap back and forth over the
lines. “He says,” she translated, “he says he’s going to drive out
Saturday to stay for a little while. Why, this is Saturday. The letter
must have been delayed.” She looked at the postmark. “This was mailed
day before yesterday. It should have been here yesterday.” She looked up
questioningly at her husband, and then her face darkened angrily. “Now
what have you got that look on you for? He doesn’t come often.”</p><p>Carl turned his eyes away from her anger. He could be stern with her
most of the time, but when occasionally her temper arose, he could not
combat it.</p><p>“What’s the matter with you?” she demanded again.</p><p>In his explanation there was a tone of apology Jody himself might have
used. “It’s just that he talks,” Carl said lamely. “Just talks.”</p><p>“Well, what of it? You talk yourself.”</p><p>“Sure I do. But your father only talks about one thing.”</p><p>“Indians!” Jody broke in excitedly. “Indians and crossing the plains!”</p><p>Carl turned fiercely on him. “You get out, Mr. Big–Britches! Go on, now!
Get out!”</p><p>Jody went miserably out the back door and closed the screen with
elaborate quietness. Under the kitchen window his shamed, downcast eyes
fell upon a curiously shaped stone, a stone of such fascination that he
squatted down and picked it up and turned it over in his hands.</p><p>The voices came clearly to him through the open kitchen window. “Jody’s
damn well right,” he heard his father say. “Just Indians and crossing
the plains. I’ve heard that story about how the horses got driven off
about a thousand times. He just goes on and on, and he never changes a
word in the things he tells.”</p><p>When Mrs. Tiflin answered her tone was so changed that Jody, outside the
window, looked up from his study of the stone. Her voice had become soft
and explanatory. Jody knew how her face would have changed to match the
tone. She said quietly, “Look at it this way, Carl. That was the big
thing in my father’s life. He led a wagon train clear across the plains
to the coast, and when it was finished, his life was done. It was a big
thing to do, but it didn’t last long enough. Look!” she continued, “it’s
as though he was born to do that, and after he finished it, there wasn’t
anything more for him to do but think about it and talk about it. If
there’d been any farther west to go, he’d have gone. He’s told me so
himself. But at last there was the ocean. He lives right by the ocean
where he had to stop.”</p><p>She had caught Carl, caught him and entangled him in her soft tone.</p><p>“I’ve seen him,” he agreed quietly. “He goes down and stares off west
over the ocean.” His voice sharpened a little. “And then he goes up to
the Horseshoe Club in Pacific Grove, and he tells people how the Indians
drove off the horses.”</p><p>She tried to catch him again. “Well, it’s everything to him. You might
be patient with him and pretend to listen.”</p><p>Carl turned impatiently away. “Well, if it gets too bad, I can always go
down to the bunkhouse and sit with Billy,” he said irritably. He walked
through the house and slammed the front door after him.</p><p>Jody ran to his chores. He dumped the grain to the chickens without
chasing any of them. He gathered the eggs from the nests. He trotted
into the house with the wood and interlaced it so carefully in the
wood–box that two armloads seemed to fill it to overflowing.</p><p>His mother had finished the beans by now. She stirred up the fire and
brushed off the stove–top with a turkey wing. Jody peered cautiously at
her to see whether any rancor toward him remained. “Is he coming today?”
Jody asked.</p><p>“That’s what his letter said.”</p><p>“Maybe I better walk up the road to meet him.”</p><p>Mrs. Tiflin clanged the stove–lid shut. “That would be nice,” she said.
“He’d probably like to be met.”</p><p>“I guess I’ll just do it then.”</p><p>Outside, Jody whistled shrilly to the dogs. “Come on up the hill,” he
commanded. The two dogs waved their tails and ran ahead. Along the
roadside the sage had tender new tips. Jody tore off some pieces and
rubbed them on his hands until the air was filled with the sharp wild
smell. With a rush the dogs leaped from the road and yapped into the
brush after a rabbit. That was the last Jody saw of them, for when they
failed to catch the rabbit, they went back home.</p><p>Jody plodded on up the hill toward the ridge top. When he reached the
little cleft where the road came through, the afternoon wind struck him
and blew up his hair and ruffled his shirt. He looked down on the little
hills and ridges below and then out at the huge green Salinas Valley. He
could see the white town of Salinas far out in the flat and the flash of
its windows under the waning sun. Directly below him, in an oak tree, a
crow congress had convened. The tree was black with crows all cawing at
once. Then Jody’s eyes followed the wagon road down from the ridge where
he stood, and lost it behind a hill, and picked it up again on the other
side. On that distant stretch he saw a cart slowly pulled by a bay
horse. It disappeared behind the hill. Jody sat down on the ground and
watched the place where the cart would reappear again. The wind sang on
the hilltops and the puff–ball clouds hurried eastward.</p><p>Then the cart came into sight and stopped. A man dressed in black
dismounted from the seat and walked to the horse’s head. Although it was
so far away, Jody knew he had unhooked the check–rein, for the horse’s
head dropped forward. The horse moved on, and the man walked slowly up
the hill beside it. Jody gave a glad cry and ran down the road toward
them. The squirrels bumped along off the road, and a road–runner flirted
its tail and raced over the edge of the hill and sailed out like a
glider.</p><p>Jody tried to leap into the middle of his shadow at every step. A stone
rolled under his foot and he went down. Around a little bend he raced,
and there, a short distance ahead, were his grandfather and the cart.
The boy dropped from his unseemly running and approached at a dignified
walk.</p><p>The horse plodded stumble–footedly up the hill and the old man walked
beside it. In the lowering sun their giant shadows flickered darkly
behind them. The grandfather was dressed in a black broadcloth suit and
he wore kid congress gaiters and a black tie on a short, hard collar. He
carried his black slouch hat in his hand. His white beard was cropped
close and his white eyebrows overhung his eyes like mustaches. The blue
eyes were sternly merry. About the whole face and figure there was a
granite dignity, so that every motion seemed an impossible thing. Once
at rest, it seemed the old man would be stone, would never move again.
His steps were slow and certain. Once made, no step could ever be
retraced; once headed in a direction, the path would never bend nor the
pace increase nor slow.</p><p>When Jody appeared around the bend, Grandfather waved his hat slowly in
welcome, and he called, “Why, Jody! Come down to meet me, have you?”</p><p>Jody sidled near and turned and matched his step to the old man’s step
and stiffened his body and dragged his heels a little. “Yes, sir,” he
said. “We got your letter only today.”</p><p>“Should have been here yesterday,” said Grandfather. “It certainly
should. How are all the folks?”</p><p>“They’re fine, sir.” He hesitated and then suggested shyly, “Would you
like to come on a mouse hunt tomorrow, sir?”</p><p>“Mouse hunt, Jody?” Grandfather chuckled. “Have the people of this
generation come down to hunting mice? They aren’t very strong, the new
people, but I hardly thought mice would be game for them.”</p><p>“No, sir. It’s just play. The haystack’s gone. I’m going to drive out
the mice to the dogs. And you can watch, or even beat the hay a little.”</p><p>The stern, merry eyes turned down on him. “I see. You don’t eat them,
then. You haven’t come to that yet.”</p><p>Jody explained, “The dogs eat them, sir. It wouldn’t be much like
hunting Indians, I guess.”</p><p>“No, not much—but then later, when the troops were hunting Indians and
shooting children and burning teepees, it wasn’t much different from
your mouse hunt.”</p><p>They topped the rise and started down into the ranch–cup, and they lost
the sun from their shoulders. “You’ve grown,” Grandfather said. “Nearly
an inch, I should say.”</p><p>“More,” Jody boasted. “Where they mark me on the door, I’m up more than
an inch since Thanksgiving even.”</p><p>Grandfather’s rich throaty voice said, “Maybe you’re getting too much
water and turning to pith and stalk. Wait until you head out, and then
we’ll see.”</p><p>Jody looked quickly into the old man’s face to see whether his feelings
should be hurt, but there was no will to injure, no punishing nor
putting–in–your–place light in the keen blue eyes. “We might kill a
pig,” Jody suggested.</p><p>“Oh, no! I couldn’t let you do that. You’re just humoring me. It isn’t
the time and you know it.”</p><p>“You know Riley, the big boar, sir?”</p><p>“Yes. I remember Riley well.”</p><p>“Well, Riley ate a hole into that same haystack, and it fell down on him
and smothered him.”</p><p>“Pigs do that when they can,” said Grandfather.</p><p>“Riley was a nice pig, for a boar, sir. I rode him sometimes, and he
didn’t mind.”</p><p>A door slammed at the house below them, and they saw Jody’s mother
standing on the porch waving her apron in welcome. And they saw Carl
Tiflin walking up from the barn to be at the house for the arrival.</p><p>The sun had disappeared from the hills by now. The blue smoke from the
house chimney hung in flat layers in the purpling ranch–cup. The
puff–ball clouds, dropped by the falling wind, hung listlessly in the
sky.</p><p>Billy Buck came out of the bunkhouse and flung a wash basin of soapy
water on the ground. He had been shaving in mid–week, for Billy held
Grandfather in reverence, and Grandfather said that Billy was one of the
few men of the new generation who had not gone soft. Although Billy was
in middle age, Grandfather considered him a boy. Now Billy was hurrying
toward the house too.</p><p>When Jody and Grandfather arrived, the three were waiting for them in
front of the yard gate.</p><p>Carl said, “Hello, sir. We’ve been looking for you.”</p><p>Mrs. Tiflin kissed Grandfather on the side of his beard, and stood still
while his big hand patted her shoulder. Billy shook hands solemnly,
grinning under his straw mustache. “I’ll put up your horse,” said Billy,
and he led the rig away.</p><p>Grandfather watched him go, and then, turning back to the group, he said
as he had said a hundred times before, “There’s a good boy. I knew his
father, old Mule–tail Buck. I never knew why they called him Mule–tail
except he packed mules.”</p><p>Mrs. Tiflin turned and led the way into the house. “How long are you
going to stay, Father? Your letter didn’t say.”</p><p>“Well, I don’t know. I thought I’d stay about two weeks. But I never
stay as long as I think I’m going to.”</p><p>In a short while they were sitting at the white oilcloth table eating
their supper. The lamp with the tin reflector hung over the table.
Outside the dining–room windows the big moths battered softly against
the glass.</p><p>Grandfather cut his steak into tiny pieces and chewed slowly. “I’m
hungry,” he said. “Driving out here got my appetite up. It’s like when
we were crossing. We all got so hungry every night we could hardly wait
to let the meat get done. I could eat about five pounds of buffalo meat
every night.”</p><p>“It’s moving around does it,” said Billy. “My father was a government
packer. I helped him when I was a kid. Just the two of us could about
clean up a deer’s ham.”</p><p>“I knew your father, Billy,” said Grandfather. “A fine man he was. They
called him Mule–tail Buck. I don’t know why except he packed mules.”</p><p>“That was it,” Billy agreed. “He packed mules.”</p><p>Grandfather put down his knife and fork and looked around the table. “I
remember one time we ran out of meat—” His voice dropped to a curious
low sing–song, dropped into a tonal groove the story had worn for
itself. “There was no buffalo, no antelope, not even rabbits. The
hunters couldn’t even shoot a coyote. That was the time for the leader
to be on the watch. I was the leader, and I kept my eyes open. Know why?
Well, just the minute the people began to get hungry they’d start
slaughtering the team oxen. Do you believe that? I’ve heard of parties
that just ate up their draft cattle. Started from the middle and worked
toward the ends. Finally they’d eat the lead pair, and then the
wheelers. The leader of a party had to keep them from doing that.”</p><p>In some manner a big moth got into the room and circled the hanging
kerosene lamp. Billy got up and tried to clap it between his hands. Carl
struck with a cupped palm and caught the moth and broke it. He walked to
the window and dropped it out.</p><p>“As I was saying,” Grandfather began again, but Carl interrupted him.
“You’d better eat some more meat. All the rest of us are ready for our
pudding.”</p><p>Jody saw a flash of anger in his mother’s eyes. Grandfather picked up
his knife and fork. “I’m pretty hungry, all right,” he said. “I’ll tell
you about that later.”</p><p>When supper was over, when the family and Billy Buck sat in front of the
fireplace in the other room, Jody anxiously watched Grandfather. He saw
the signs he knew. The bearded head leaned forward; the eyes lost their
sternness and looked wonderingly into the fire; the big lean fingers
laced themselves on the black knees.</p><p>“I wonder,” he began, “I just wonder whether I ever told you how those
thieving Piutes drove off thirty–five of our horses.”</p><p>“I think you did,” Carl interrupted. “Wasn’t it just before you went up
into the Tahoe country?”</p><p>Grandfather turned quickly toward his son–in–law. “That’s right. I guess
I must have told you that story.”</p><p>“Lots of times,” Carl said cruelly, and he avoided his wife’s eyes. But
he felt the angry eyes on him, and he said, “’Course I’d like to hear it
again.”</p><p>Grandfather looked back at the fire. His fingers unlaced and laced
again. Jody knew how he felt, how his insides were collapsed and empty.
Hadn’t Jody been called a Big–Britches that very afternoon? He arose to
heroism and opened himself to the term Big–Britches again. “Tell about
Indians,” he said softly.</p><p>Grandfather’s eyes grew stern again. “Boys always want to hear about
Indians. It was a job for men, but boys want to hear about it. Well,
let’s see. Did I ever tell you how I wanted each wagon to carry a long
iron plate?”</p><p>Everyone but Jody remained silent. Jody said, “No. You didn’t.”</p><p>“Well, when the Indians attacked, we always put the wagons in a circle
and fought from between the wheels. I thought that if every wagon
carried a long plate with rifle holes, the men could stand the plates on
the outside of the wheels when the wagons were in the circle and they
would be protected. It would save lives and that would make up for the
extra weight of the iron. But of course the party wouldn’t do it. No
party had done it before and they couldn’t see why they should go to the
expense. They lived to regret it, too.”</p><p>Jody looked at his mother, and knew from her expression that she was not
listening at all. Carl picked at a callus on his thumb and Billy Buck
watched a spider crawling up the wall.</p><p>Grandfather’s tone dropped into its narrative groove again. Jody knew in
advance exactly what words would fall. The story droned on, speeded up
for the attack, grew sad over the wounds, struck a dirge at the burials
on the great plains. Jody sat quietly watching Grandfather. The stern
blue eyes were detached. He looked as though he were not very interested
in the story himself.</p><p>When it was finished, when the pause had been politely respected as the
frontier of the story, Billy Buck stood up and stretched and hitched his
trousers. “I guess I’ll turn in,” he said. Then he faced Grandfather.
“I’ve got an old powder horn and a cap and ball pistol down to the
bunkhouse. Did I ever show them to you?”</p><p>Grandfather nodded slowly. “Yes, I think you did, Billy. Reminds me of a
pistol I had when I was leading the people across.” Billy stood politely
until the little story was done, and then he said, “Good night,” and
went out of the house.</p><p>Carl Tiflin tried to turn the conversation then. “How’s the country
between here and Monterey? I’ve heard it’s pretty dry.”</p><p>“It is dry,” said Grandfather. “There’s not a drop of water in the
Laguna Seca. But it’s a long pull from ’87. The whole country was powder
then, and in ’61 I believe all the coyotes starved to death. We had
fifteen inches of rain this year.”</p><p>“Yes, but it all came too early. We could do with some now.” Carl’s eye
fell on Jody. “Hadn’t you better be getting to bed?”</p><p>Jody stood up obediently. “Can I kill the mice in the old haystack,
sir?”</p><p>“Mice? Oh! Sure, kill them all off. Billy said there isn’t any good hay
left.”</p><p>Jody exchanged a secret and satisfying look with Grandfather. “I’ll kill
every one tomorrow,” he promised.</p><p>Jody lay in his bed and thought of the impossible world of Indians and
buffaloes, a world that had ceased to be forever. He wished he could
have been living in the heroic time, but he knew he was not of heroic
timber. No one living now, save possibly Billy Buck, was worthy to do
the things that had been done. A race of giants had lived then, fearless
men, men of a staunchness unknown in this day. Jody thought of the wide
plains and of the wagons moving across like centipedes. He thought of
Grandfather on a huge white horse, marshaling the people. Across his
mind marched the great phantoms, and they marched off the earth and they
were gone.</p><p>He came back to the ranch for a moment, then. He heard the dull rushing
sound that space and silence make. He heard one of the dogs, out in the
doghouse, scratching a flea and bumping his elbow against the floor with
every stroke. Then the wind arose again and the black cypress groaned
and Jody went to sleep.</p><p>He was up half an hour before the triangle sounded for breakfast. His
mother was rattling the stove to make the flames roar when Jody went
through the kitchen. “You’re up early,” she said. “Where are you going?”</p><p>“Out to get a good stick. We’re going to kill the mice today.”</p><p>“Who is ‘we’?”</p><p>“Why, Grandfather and I.”</p><p>“So you’ve got him in it. You always like to have some one in with you
in case there’s blame to share.”</p><p>“I’ll be right back,” said Jody. “I just want to have a good stick ready
for after breakfast.”</p><p>He closed the screen door after him and went out into the cool blue
morning. The birds were noisy in the dawn and the ranch cats came down
from the hill like blunt snakes. They had been hunting gophers in the
dark, and although the four cats were full of gopher meat, they sat in a
semi–circle at the back door and mewed piteously for milk. Doubletree
Mutt and Smasher moved sniffing along the edge of the brush, performing
the duty with rigid ceremony, but when Jody whistled, their heads jerked
up and their tails waved. They plunged down to him, wriggling their
skins and yawning. Jody patted their heads seriously, and moved on to
the weathered scrap pile. He selected an old broom handle and a short
piece of inch–square scrap wood. From his pocket he took a shoelace and
tied the ends of the sticks loosely together to make a flail. He
whistled his new weapon through the air and struck the ground
experimentally, while the dogs leaped aside and whined with
apprehension.</p><p>Jody turned and started down past the house toward the old haystack
ground to look over the field of slaughter, but Billy Buck, sitting
patiently on the back steps, called to him, “You better come back. It’s
only a couple of minutes till breakfast.”</p><p>Jody changed his course and moved toward the house. He leaned his flail
against the steps. “That’s to drive the mice out,” he said. “I’ll bet
they’re fat. I’ll bet they don’t know what’s going to happen to them
today.”</p><p>“No, nor you either,” Billy remarked philosophically, “nor me, nor
anyone.”</p><p>Jody was staggered by this thought. He knew it was true. His imagination
twitched away from the mouse hunt. Then his mother came out on the back
porch and struck the triangle, and all thoughts fell in a heap.</p><p>Grandfather hadn’t appeared at the table when they sat down. Billy
nodded at his empty chair. “He’s all right? He isn’t sick?”</p><p>“He takes a long time to dress,” said Mrs. Tiflin. “He combs his
whiskers and rubs up his shoes and brushes his clothes.”</p><p>Carl scattered sugar on his mush. “A man that’s led a wagon train across
the plains has got to be pretty careful how he dresses.”</p><p>Mrs. Tiflin turned on him. “Don’t do that, Carl! Please don’t!” There
was more of threat than of request in her tone. And the threat irritated
Carl.</p><p>“Well, how many times do I have to listen to the story of the iron
plates, and the thirty–five horses? That time’s done. Why can’t he
forget it, now it’s done?” He grew angrier while he talked, and his
voice rose. “Why does he have to tell them over and over? He came across
the plains. All right! Now it’s finished. Nobody wants to hear about it
over and over.”</p><p>The door into the kitchen closed softly. The four at the table sat
frozen. Carl laid his mush spoon on the table and touched his chin with
his fingers.</p><p>Then the kitchen door opened and Grandfather walked in. His mouth smiled
tightly and his eyes were squinted. “Good morning,” he said, and he sat
down and looked at his mush dish.</p><p>Carl could not leave it there. “Did—did you hear what I said?”</p><p>Grandfather jerked a little nod.</p><p>“I don’t know what got into me, sir. I didn’t mean it. I was just being
funny.”</p><p>Jody glanced in shame at his mother, and he saw that she was looking at
Carl, and that she wasn’t breathing. It was an awful thing that he was
doing. He was tearing himself to pieces to talk like that. It was a
terrible thing to him to retract a word, but to retract it in shame was
infinitely worse.</p><p>Grandfather looked sidewise. “I’m trying to get right side up,” he said
gently. “I’m not being mad. I don’t mind what you said, but it might be
true, and I would mind that.”</p><p>“It isn’t true,” said Carl. “I’m not feeling well this morning. I’m
sorry I said it.”</p><p>“Don’t be sorry, Carl. An old man doesn’t see things sometimes. Maybe
you’re right. The crossing is finished. Maybe it should be forgotten,
now it’s done.”</p><p>Carl got up from the table. “I’ve had enough to eat. I’m going to work.
Take your time, Billy!” He walked quickly out of the dining–room. Billy
gulped the rest of his food and followed soon after. But Jody could not
leave his chair.</p><p>“Won’t you tell any more stories?” Jody asked.</p><p>“Why, sure I’ll tell them, but only when—I’m sure people want to hear
them.”</p><p>“I like to hear them, sir.”</p><p>“Oh! Of course you do, but you’re a little boy. It was a job for men,
but only little boys like to hear about it.”</p><p>Jody got up from his place. “I’ll wait outside for you, sir. I’ve got a
good stick for those mice.”</p><p>He waited by the gate until the old man came out on the porch. “Let’s go
down and kill the mice now,” Jody called.</p><p>“I think I’ll just sit in the sun, Jody. You go kill the mice.”</p><p>“You can use my stick if you like.”</p><p>“No, I’ll just sit here a while.”</p><p>Jody turned disconsolately away, and walked down toward the old
haystack. He tried to whip up his enthusiasm with thoughts of the fat
juicy mice. He beat the ground with his flail. The dogs coaxed and
whined about him, but he could not go. Back at the house he could see
Grandfather sitting on the porch, looking small and thin and black.</p><p>Jody gave up and went to sit on the steps at the old man’s feet.</p><p>“Back already? Did you kill the mice?”</p><p>“No, sir. I’ll kill them some other day.”</p><p>The morning flies buzzed close to the ground and the ants dashed about
in front of the steps. The heavy smell of sage slipped down the hill.
The porch boards grew warm in the sunshine.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/i127.jpg" alt="Illustration"/></div><p>Jody hardly knew when Grandfather started to talk. “I shouldn’t stay
here, feeling the way I do.” He examined his strong old hands. “I feel
as though the crossing wasn’t worth doing.” His eyes moved up the
side–hill and stopped on a motionless hawk perched on a dead limb. “I
tell those old stories, but they’re not what I want to tell. I only know
how I want people to feel when I tell them.</p><p>“It wasn’t Indians that were important, nor adventures, nor even getting
out here. It was a whole bunch of people made into one big crawling
beast. And I was the head. It was westering and westering. Every man
wanted something for himself, but the big beast that was all of them
wanted only westering. I was the leader, but if I hadn’t been there,
someone else would have been the head. The thing had to have a head.</p><p>“Under the little bushes the shadows were black at white noonday. When
we saw the mountains at last, we cried—all of us. But it wasn’t getting
here that mattered, it was movement and westering.</p><p>“We carried life out here and set it down the way those ants carry eggs.
And I was the leader. The westering was as big as God, and the slow
steps that made the movement piled up and piled up until the continent
was crossed.</p><p>“Then we came down to the sea, and it was done.” He stopped and wiped
his eyes until the rims were red. “That’s what I should be telling
instead of stories.”</p><p>When Jody spoke, Grandfather started and looked down at him. “Maybe I
could lead the people some day,” Jody said.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/i130.jpg" alt="Illustration"/></div><p>The old man smiled. “There’s no place to go. There’s the ocean to stop
you. There’s a line of old men along the shore hating the ocean because
it stopped them.”</p><p>“In boats I might, sir.”</p><p>“No place to go, Jody. Every place is taken. But that’s not the
worst—no, not the worst. Westering has died out of the people.
Westering isn’t a hunger any more. It’s all done. Your father is right.
It is finished.” He laced his fingers on his knee and looked at them.</p><p>Jody felt very sad. “If you’d like a glass of lemonade I could make it
for you.”</p><p>Grandfather was about to refuse, and then he saw Jody’s face. “That
would be nice,” he said. “Yes, it would be nice to drink a lemonade.”</p><p>Jody ran into the kitchen where his mother was wiping the last of the
breakfast dishes. “Can I have a lemon to make a lemonade for
Grandfather?”</p><p>His mother mimicked—“And another lemon to make a lemonade for you.”</p><p>“No, ma’am. I don’t want one.”</p><p>“Jody! You’re sick!” Then she stopped suddenly. “Take a lemon out of the
cooler,” she said softly. “Here, I’ll reach the squeezer down to you.”</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>THE END</p></blockquote></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/endpaper.jpg" alt="Illustration"/></div></section><footer/></body></html>
