listlessly looked about the ranch for something to do. He had been to
the barn, had thrown rocks at the swallows’ nests under the eaves until
every one of the little mud houses broke open and dropped its lining of
straw and dirty feathers. Then at the ranch house he baited a rat trap
with stale cheese and set it where Doubletree Mutt, that good big dog,
would get his nose snapped. Jody was not moved by an impulse of cruelty;
he was bored with the long hot afternoon. Doubletree Mutt put his stupid
nose in the trap and got it smacked, and shrieked with agony and limped
away with blood on his nostrils. No matter where he was hurt, Mutt
limped. It was just a way he had. Once when he was young, Mutt got
caught in a coyote trap, and always after that he limped, even when he
was scolded.</p><p>When Mutt yelped, Jody’s mother called from inside the house, “Jody!
Stop torturing that dog and find something to do.”</p><p>Jody felt mean then, so he threw a rock at Mutt. Then he took his
slingshot from the porch and walked up toward the brush line to try to
kill a bird. It was a good slingshot, with store–bought rubbers, but
while Jody had often shot at birds, he had never hit one. He walked up
through the vegetable patch, kicking his bare toes into the dust. And on
the way he found the perfect slingshot stone, round and slightly
flattened and heavy enough to carry through the air. He fitted it into
the leather pouch of his weapon and proceeded to the brush line. His
eyes narrowed, his mouth worked strenuously; for the first time that
afternoon he was intent. In the shade of the sagebrush the little birds
were working, scratching in the leaves, flying restlessly a few feet and
scratching again. Jody pulled back the rubbers of the sling and advanced
cautiously. One little thrush paused and looked at him and crouched,
ready to fly. Jody sidled nearer, moving one foot slowly after the
other. When he was twenty feet away, he carefully raised the sling and
aimed. The stone whizzed; the thrush started up and flew right into it.
And down the little bird went with a broken head. Jody ran to it and
picked it up.</p><p>“Well, I got you,” he said.</p><p>The bird looked much smaller dead than it had alive. Jody felt a little
mean pain in his stomach, so he took out his pocketknife and cut off the
bird’s head. Then he disemboweled it, and took off its wings; and
finally he threw all the pieces into the brush. He didn’t care about the
bird, or its life, but he knew what older people would say if they had
seen him kill it; he was ashamed because of their potential opinion. He
decided to forget the whole thing as quickly as he could, and never to
mention it.</p><p>The hills were dry at this season, and the wild grass was golden, but
where the spring–pipe filled the round tub and the tub spilled over,
there lay a stretch of fine green grass, deep and sweet and moist. Jody
drank from the mossy tub and washed the bird’s blood from his hands in
cold water. Then he lay on his back in the grass and looked up at the
dumpling summer clouds. By closing one eye and destroying perspective he
brought them down within reach so that he could put up his fingers and
stroke them. He helped the gentle wind push them down the sky; it seemed
to him that they went faster for his help. One fat white cloud he helped
clear to the mountain rims and pressed it firmly over, out of sight.
Jody wondered what it was seeing, then. He sat up the better to look at
the great mountains where they went piling back, growing darker and more
savage until they finished with one jagged ridge, high up against the
west. Curious secret mountains; he thought of the little he knew about
them.</p><p>“What’s on the other side?” he asked his father once.</p><p>“More mountains, I guess. Why?”</p><p>“And on the other side of them?”</p><p>“More mountains. Why?”</p><p>“More mountains on and on?”</p><p>“Well, no. At last you come to the ocean.”</p><p>“But what’s in the mountains?”</p><p>“Just cliffs and brush and rocks and dryness.”</p><p>“Were you ever there?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Has anybody ever been there?”</p><p>“A few people, I guess. It’s dangerous, with cliffs and things. Why,
I’ve read there’s more unexplored country in the mountains of Monterey
County than any place in the United States.” His father seemed proud
that this should be so.</p><p>“And at last the ocean?”</p><p>“At last the ocean.”</p><p>“But,” the boy insisted, “but in between? No one knows?”</p><p>“Oh, a few people do, I guess. But there’s nothing there to get. And not
much water. Just rocks and cliffs and greasewood. Why?”</p><p>“It would be good to go.”</p><p>“What for? There’s nothing there.”</p><p>Jody knew something was there, something very wonderful because it
wasn’t known, something secret and mysterious. He could feel within
himself that this was so. He said to his mother, “Do you know what’s in
the big mountains?”</p><p>She looked at him and then back at the ferocious range, and she said,
“Only the bear, I guess.”</p><p>“What bear?”</p><p>“Why the one that went over the mountain to see what he could see.”</p><p>Jody questioned Billy Buck, the ranch–hand, about the possibility of
ancient cities lost in the mountains, but Billy agreed with Jody’s
father.</p><p>“It ain’t likely,” Billy said. “There’d be nothing to eat unless a kind
of people that can eat rocks live there.”</p><p>That was all the information Jody ever got, and it made the mountains
dear to him, and terrible. He thought often of the miles of ridge after
ridge until at last there was the sea. When the peaks were pink in the
morning they invited him among them: and when the sun had gone over the
edge in the evening and the mountains were a purple–like despair, then
Jody was afraid of them; then they were so impersonal and aloof that
their very imperturbability was a threat.</p><p>Now he turned his head toward the mountains of the east, the Gabilans,
and they were jolly mountains, with hill ranches in their creases, and
with pine trees growing on the crests. People lived there, and battles
had been fought against the Mexicans on the slopes. He looked back for
an instant at the Great Ones and shivered a little at the contrast. The
foothill cup of the home ranch below him was sunny and safe. The house
gleamed with white light and the barn was brown and warm. The red cows
on the farther hill ate their way slowly toward the north. Even the dark
cypress tree by the bunkhouse was usual and safe. The chickens scratched
about in the dust of the farmyard with quick waltzing steps.</p><p>Then a moving figure caught Jody’s eye. A man walked slowly over the
brow of the hill, on the road from Salinas, and he was headed toward the
house. Jody stood up and moved down toward the house too, for if someone
was coming, he wanted to be there to see. By the time the boy had got to
the house the walking man was only halfway down the road, a lean man,
very straight in the shoulders. Jody could tell he was old only because
his heels struck the ground with hard jerks. As he approached nearer,
Jody saw that he was dressed in blue jeans and in a coat of the same
material. He wore clodhopper shoes and an old flat–brimmed Stetson hat.
Over his shoulder he carried a gunny sack, lumpy and full. In a few
moments he had trudged close enough so that his face could be seen. And
his face was as dark as dried beef. A mustache, blue–white against the
dark skin, hovered over his mouth, and his hair was white, too, where it
showed at his neck. The skin of his face had shrunk back against the
skull until it defined bone, not flesh, and made the nose and chin seem
sharp and fragile. The eyes were large and deep and dark, with eyelids
stretched tightly over them. Irises and pupils were one, and very black,
but the eyeballs were brown. There were no wrinkles in the face at all.
This old man wore a blue denim coat buttoned to the throat with brass
buttons, as all men do who wear no shirts. Out of the sleeves came
strong bony wrists and hands gnarled and knotted and hard as peach
branches. The nails were flat and blunt and shiny.</p><p>The old man drew close to the gate and swung down his sack when he
confronted Jody. His lips fluttered a little and a soft impersonal voice
came from between them. “Do you live here?”</p><p>Jody was embarrassed. He turned and looked at the house, and he turned
back and looked toward the barn where his father and Billy Buck were.
“Yes,” he said, when no help came from either direction.</p><p>“I have come back,” the old man said. “I am Gitano, and I have come
back.”</p><p>Jody could not take all this responsibility. He turned abruptly, and ran
into the house for help, and the screen door banged after him. His
mother was in the kitchen poking out the clogged holes of a colander
with a hairpin, and biting her lower lip with concentration.</p><p>“It’s an old man,” Jody cried excitedly. “It’s an old paisano man, and
he says he’s come back.”</p><p>His mother put down the colander and stuck the hairpin behind the sink
board. “What’s the matter now?” she asked patiently.</p><p>“It’s an old man outside. Come on out.”</p><p>“Well, what does he want?” She untied the strings of her apron and
smoothed her hair with her fingers.</p><p>“I don’t know. He came walking.”</p><p>His mother smoothed down her dress and went out, and Jody followed her.
Gitano had not moved.</p><p>“Yes?” Mrs. Tiflin asked.</p><p>Gitano took off his old black hat and held it with both hands in front
of him. He repeated, “I am Gitano, and I have come back.”</p><p>“Come back? Back where?”</p><p>Gitano’s whole straight body leaned forward a little. His right hand
described the circle of the hills, the sloping fields and the mountains,
and ended at his hat again. “Back to the rancho. I was born here, and my
father, too.”</p><p>“Here?” she demanded. “This isn’t an old place.”</p><p>“No, there,” he said, pointing to the western ridge. “On the other side
there, in a house that is gone.”</p><p>At last she understood. “The old ’dobe that’s washed almost away, you
mean?”</p><p>“Yes, <span class="emphasis"><em>señora</em></span>. When the rancho broke up they put no more lime on the
’dobe, and the rains washed it down.”</p><p>Jody’s mother was silent for a little, and curious homesick thoughts ran
through her mind, but quickly she cleared them out. “And what do you
want here now, Gitano?”</p><p>“I will stay here,” he said quietly, “until I die.”</p><p>“But we don’t need an extra man here.”</p><p>“I can not work hard any more, <span class="emphasis"><em>señora</em></span>. I can milk a cow, feed
chickens, cut a little wood; no more. I will stay here.” He indicated
the sack on the ground beside him. “Here are my things.”</p><p>She turned to Jody. “Run down to the barn and call your father.”</p><p>Jody dashed away, and he returned with Carl Tiflin and Billy Buck behind
him. The old man was standing as he had been, but he was resting now.
His whole body had sagged into a timeless repose.</p><p>“What is it?” Carl Tiflin asked. “What’s Jody so excited about?”</p><p>Mrs. Tiflin motioned to the old man. “He wants to stay here. He wants to
do a little work and stay here.”</p><p>“Well, we can’t have him. We don’t need any more men. He’s too old.
Billy does everything we need.”</p><p>They had been talking over him as though he did not exist, and now,
suddenly, they both hesitated and looked at Gitano and were embarrassed.</p><p>He cleared his throat. “I am too old to work. I come back where I was
born.”</p><p>“You weren’t born here,” Carl said sharply.</p><p>“No. In the ’dobe house over the hill. It was all one rancho before you
came.”</p><p>“In the mud house that’s all melted down?”</p><p>“Yes. I and my father. I will stay here now on the rancho.”</p><p>“I tell you you won’t stay,” Carl said angrily. “I don’t need an old
man. This isn’t a big ranch. I can’t afford food and doctor bills for an
old man. You must have relatives and friends. Go to them. It is like
begging to come to strangers.”</p><p>“I was born here,” Gitano said patiently and inflexibly.</p><p>Carl Tiflin didn’t like to be cruel, but he felt he must. “You can eat
here tonight,” he said. “You can sleep in the little room of the old
bunkhouse. We’ll give you your breakfast in the morning, and then you’ll
have to go along. Go to your friends. Don’t come to die with strangers.”</p><p>Gitano put on his black hat and stooped for the sack. “Here are my
things,” he said.</p><p>Carl turned away. “Come on, Billy, we’ll finish down at the barn. Jody,
show him the little room in the bunkhouse.”</p><p>He and Billy turned back toward the barn. Mrs. Tiflin went into the
house, saying over her shoulder, “I’ll send some blankets down.”</p><p>Gitano looked questioningly at Jody. “I’ll show you where it is,” Jody
said.</p><p>There was a cot with a shuck mattress, an apple box holding a tin
lantern, and a backless rocking–chair in the little room of the
bunkhouse. Gitano laid his sack carefully on the floor and sat down on
the bed. Jody stood shyly in the room, hesitating to go. At last he
said,</p><p>“Did you come out of the big mountains?”</p><p>Gitano shook his head slowly. “No, I worked down the Salinas Valley.”</p><p>The afternoon thought would not let Jody go. “Did you ever go into the
big mountains back there?”</p><p>The old dark eyes grew fixed, and their light turned inward on the years
that were living in Gitano’s head. “Once—when I was a little boy. I
went with my father.”</p><p>“Way back, clear into the mountains?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“What was there?” Jody cried. “Did you see any people or any houses?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Well, what was there?”</p><p>Gitano’s eyes remained inward. A little wrinkled strain came between his
brows.</p><p>“What did you see in there?” Jody repeated.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Gitano said. “I don’t remember.”</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/i063.jpg" alt="Illustration"/></div><p>“Was it terrible and dry?”</p><p>“I don’t remember.”</p><p>In his excitement, Jody had lost his shyness. “Don’t you remember
anything about it?”</p><p>Gitano’s mouth opened for a word, and remained open while his brain
sought the word. “I think it was quiet—I think it was nice.”</p><p>Gitano’s eyes seemed to have found something back in the years, for they
grew soft and a little smile seemed to come and go in them.</p><p>“Didn’t you ever go back in the mountains again?” Jody insisted.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Didn’t you ever want to?”</p><p>But now Gitano’s face became impatient. “No,” he said in a tone that
told Jody he didn’t want to talk about it any more. The boy was held by
a curious fascination. He didn’t want to go away from Gitano. His
shyness returned.</p><p>“Would you like to come down to the barn and see the stock?” he asked.</p><p>Gitano stood up and put on his hat and prepared to follow.</p><p>It was almost evening now. They stood near the watering trough while the
horses sauntered in from the hillsides for an evening drink. Gitano
rested his big twisted hands on the top rail of the fence. Five horses
came down and drank, and then stood about, nibbling at the dirt or
rubbing their sides against the polished wood of the fence. Long after
they had finished drinking an old horse appeared over the brow of the
hill and came painfully down. It had long yellow teeth; its hoofs were
flat and sharp as spades, and its ribs and hip–bones jutted out under
its skin. It hobbled up to the trough and drank water with a loud
sucking noise.</p><p>“That’s old Easter,” Jody explained. “That’s the first horse my father
ever had. He’s thirty years old.” He looked up into Gitano’s old eyes
for some response.</p><p>“No good any more,” Gitano said.</p><p>Jody’s father and Billy Buck came out of the barn and walked over.</p><p>“Too old to work,” Gitano repeated. “Just eats and pretty soon dies.”</p><p>Carl Tiflin caught the last words. He hated his brutality toward old
Gitano, and so he became brutal again.</p><p>“It’s a shame not to shoot Easter,” he said. “It’d save him a lot of
pains and rheumatism.” He looked secretly at Gitano, to see whether he
noticed the parallel, but the big bony hands did not move, nor did the
dark eyes turn from the horse. “Old things ought to be put out of their
misery,” Jody’s father went on. “One shot, a big noise, one big pain in
the head maybe, and that’s all. That’s better than stiffness and sore
teeth.”</p><p>Billy Buck broke in. “They got a right to rest after they worked all of
their life. Maybe they like to just walk around.”</p><p>Carl had been looking steadily at the skinny horse. “You can’t imagine
now what Easter used to look like,” he said softly. “High neck, deep
chest, fine barrel. He could jump a five–bar gate in stride. I won a
flat race on him when I was fifteen years old. I could of got two
hundred dollars for him any time. You wouldn’t think how pretty he was.”
He checked himself, for he hated softness. “But he ought to be shot
now,” he said.</p><p>“He’s got a right to rest,” Billy Buck insisted.</p><p>Jody’s father had a humorous thought. He turned to Gitano. “If ham and
eggs grew on a side–hill I’d turn you out to pasture too,” he said. “But
I can’t afford to pasture you in my kitchen.”</p><p>He laughed to Billy Buck about it as they went on toward the house. “Be
a good thing for all of us if ham and eggs grew on the side–hills.”</p><p>Jody knew how his father was probing for a place to hurt in Gitano. He
had been probed often. His father knew every place in the boy where a
word would fester.</p><p>“He’s only talking,” Jody said. “He didn’t mean it about shooting
Easter. He likes Easter. That was the first horse he ever owned.”</p><p>The sun sank behind the high mountains as they stood there, and the
ranch was hushed. Gitano seemed to be more at home in the evening. He
made a curious sharp sound with his lips and stretched one of his hands
over the fence. Old Easter moved stiffly to him, and Gitano rubbed the
lean neck under the mane.</p><p>“You like him?” Jody asked softly.</p><p>“Yes—but he’s no damn good.”</p><p>The triangle sounded at the ranch house. “That’s supper,” Jody cried.
“Come on up to supper.”</p><p>As they walked up toward the house Jody noticed again that Gitano’s body
was as straight as that of a young man. Only by a jerkiness in his
movements and by the scuffling of his heels could it be seen that he was
old.</p><p>The turkeys were flying heavily into the lower branches of the cypress
tree by the bunkhouse. A fat sleek ranch cat walked across the road
carrying a rat so large that its tail dragged on the ground. The quail
on the side–hills were still sounding the clear water call.</p><p>Jody and Gitano came to the back steps and Mrs. Tiflin looked out
through the screen door at them.</p><p>“Come running, Jody. Come in to supper, Gitano.”</p><p>Carl and Billy Buck had started to eat at the long oilcloth–covered
table. Jody slipped into his chair without moving it, but Gitano stood
holding his hat until Carl looked up and said, “Sit down, sit down. You
might as well get your belly full before you go on.” Carl was afraid he
might relent and let the old man stay, and so he continued to remind
himself that this couldn’t be.</p><p>Gitano laid his hat on the floor and diffidently sat down. He wouldn’t
reach for food. Carl had to pass it to him. “Here, fill yourself up.”
Gitano ate very slowly, cutting tiny pieces of meat and arranging little
pats of mashed potato on his plate.</p><p>The situation would not stop worrying Carl Tiflin. “Haven’t you got any
relatives in this part of the country?” he asked.</p><p>Gitano answered with some pride, “My brother–in–law is in Monterey. I
have cousins there, too.”</p><p>“Well, you can go and live there, then.”</p><p>“I was born here,” Gitano said in gentle rebuke.</p><p>Jody’s mother came in from the kitchen, carrying a large bowl of tapioca
pudding.</p><p>Carl chuckled to her, “Did I tell you what I said to him? I said if ham
and eggs grew on the side–hills I’d put him out to pasture, like old
Easter.”</p><p>Gitano stared unmoved at his plate.</p><p>“It’s too bad he can’t stay,” said Mrs. Tiflin.</p><p>“Now don’t you start anything,” Carl said crossly.</p><p>When they had finished eating, Carl and Billy Buck and Jody went into
the living–room to sit for a while, but Gitano, without a word of
farewell or thanks, walked through the kitchen and out the back door.
Jody sat and secretly watched his father. He knew how mean his father
felt.</p><p>“This country’s full of these old <span class="emphasis"><em>paisanos</em></span>,” Carl said to Billy Buck.</p><p>“They’re damn good men,” Billy defended them. “They can work older than
white men. I saw one of them a hundred and five years old, and he could
still ride a horse. You don’t see any white men as old as Gitano walking
twenty or thirty miles.”</p><p>“Oh, they’re tough, all right,” Carl agreed. “Say, are you standing up
for him too? Listen, Billy,” he explained, “I’m having a hard enough
time keeping this ranch out of the Bank of Italy without taking on
anybody else to feed. You know that, Billy.”</p><p>“Sure, I know,” said Billy. “If you was rich, it’d be different.”</p><p>“That’s right, and it isn’t like he didn’t have relatives to go to. A
brother–in–law and cousins right in Monterey. Why should I worry about
him?”</p><p>Jody sat quietly listening, and he seemed to hear Gitano’s gentle voice
and its unanswerable, “But I was born here.” Gitano was mysterious like
the mountains. There were ranges back as far as you could see, but
behind the last range piled up against the sky there was a great unknown
country. And Gitano was an old man, until you got to the dull dark eyes.
And in behind them was some unknown thing. He didn’t ever say enough to
let you guess what was inside, under the eyes. Jody felt himself
irresistibly drawn toward the bunkhouse. He slipped from his chair while
his father was talking and he went out the door without making a sound.</p><p>The night was very dark and far–off noises carried in clearly. The
hamebells of a wood team sounded from way over the hill on the county
road. Jody picked his way across the dark yard. He could see a light
through the window of the little room of the bunkhouse. Because the
night was secret he walked quietly up to the window and peered in.
Gitano sat in the rocking–chair and his back was toward the window. His
right arm moved slowly back and forth in front of him. Jody pushed the
door open and walked in. Gitano jerked upright and, seizing a piece of
deerskin, he tried to throw it over the thing in his lap, but the skin
slipped away. Jody stood overwhelmed by the thing in Gitano’s hand, a
lean and lovely rapier with a golden basket hilt. The blade was like a
thin ray of dark light. The hilt was pierced and intricately carved.</p><p>“What is it?” Jody demanded.</p><p>Gitano only looked at him with resentful eyes, and he picked up the
fallen deerskin and firmly wrapped the beautiful blade in it.</p><p>Jody put out his hand. “Can’t I see it?”</p><p>Gitano’s eyes smoldered angrily and he shook his head.</p><p>“Where’d you get it? Where’d it come from?”</p><p>Now Gitano regarded him profoundly, as though he pondered. “I got it
from my father.”</p><p>“Well, where’d he get it?”</p><p>Gitano looked down at the long deerskin parcel in his hand. “I don’t
know.”</p><p>“Didn’t he ever tell you?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“What do you do with it?”</p><p>Gitano looked slightly surprised. “Nothing. I just keep it.”</p><p>“Can’t I see it again?”</p><p>The old man slowly unwrapped the shining blade and let the lamplight
slip along it for a moment. Then he wrapped it up again. “You go now. I
want to go to bed.” He blew out the lamp almost before Jody had closed
the door.</p><p>As he went back toward the house, Jody knew one thing more sharply than
he had ever known anything. He must never tell anyone about the rapier.
It would be a dreadful thing to tell anyone about it, for it would
destroy some fragile structure of truth. It was a truth that might be
shattered by division.</p><p>On the way across the dark yard Jody passed Billy Buck. “They’re
wondering where you are,” Billy said.</p><p>Jody slipped into the living–room, and his father turned to him. “Where
have you been?”</p><p>“I just went out to see if I caught any rats in my new trap.”</p><p>“It’s time you went to bed,” his father said.</p><p class="center">*        *        *        *        *</p><p>Jody was first at the breakfast table in the morning. Then his father
came in, and last, Billy Buck. Mrs. Tiflin looked in from the kitchen.</p><p>“Where’s the old man, Billy?” she asked.</p><p>“I guess he’s out walking,” Billy said. “I looked in his room and he
wasn’t there.”</p><p>“Maybe he started early to Monterey,” said Carl. “It’s a long walk.”</p><p>“No,” Billy explained. “His sack is in the little room.”</p><p>After breakfast Jody walked down to the bunkhouse. Flies were flashing
about in the sunshine. The ranch seemed especially quiet this morning.
When he was sure no one was watching him, Jody went into the little
room, and looked into Gitano’s sack. An extra pair of long cotton
underwear was there, an extra pair of jeans and three pairs of worn
socks. Nothing else was in the sack. A sharp loneliness fell on Jody. He
walked slowly back toward the house. His father stood on the porch
talking to Mrs. Tiflin.</p><p>“I guess old Easter’s dead at last,” he said. “I didn’t see him come
down to water with the other horses.”</p><p>In the middle of the morning Jess Taylor from the ridge ranch rode down.</p><p>“You didn’t sell that old gray crowbait of yours, did you, Carl?”</p><p>“No, of course not. Why?”</p><p>“Well,” Jess said. “I was out this morning early, and I saw a funny
thing. I saw an old man on an old horse, no saddle, only a piece of rope
for a bridle. He wasn’t on the road at all. He was cutting right up
straight through the brush. I think he had a gun. At least I saw
something shine in his hand.”</p><p>“That’s old Gitano,” Carl Tiflin said. “I’ll see if any of my guns are
missing.” He stepped into the house for a second. “Nope, all here. Which
way was he heading, Jess?”</p><p>“Well, that’s the funny thing. He was heading straight back into the
mountains.”</p><p>Carl laughed. “They never get too old to steal,” he said. “I guess he
just stole old Easter.”</p><p>“Want to go after him, Carl?”</p><p>“Hell no, just save me burying that horse. I wonder where he got the
gun. I wonder what he wants back there.”</p><p>Jody walked up through the vegetable patch, toward the brush line. He
looked searchingly at the towering mountains—ridge after ridge after
ridge until at last there was the ocean. For a moment he thought he
could see a black speck crawling up the farthest ridge. Jody thought of
the rapier and of Gitano. And he thought of the great mountains. A
longing caressed him, and it was so sharp that he wanted to cry to get
it out of his breast. He lay down in the green grass near the round tub
at the brush line. He covered his eyes with his crossed arms and lay
there a long time, and he was full of a nameless sorrow.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/i073.jpg" alt="Illustration"/></div></section><footer/></body></html>
