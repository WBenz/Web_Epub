special and very select club. There was no entrance fee and no
subscription, in which respect it differed from all other clubs. Its
membership was limited to six: the <span class="emphasis"><em>Actor</em></span>, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Barrister</em></span>, the
<span class="emphasis"><em>Doctor</em></span>, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Ordinary Man</em></span>, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Soldier</em></span>, and the <span class="emphasis"><em>Writer</em></span>. And since
each in his own particular trade had achieved what the world calls fame,
except the Ordinary Man, who was only ordinary, it was decided that for
purposes of convenience they should be entered in the list of members
alphabetically according to their trade, and further that they should
carry out the only rule of the club in the order of that entry. And the
only rule of the club was, that on certain nights, to be mutually agreed
on, the member whose turn it was should give to the remaining members an
exceedingly good dinner, after which he should tell them a story
connected with his own trade, that should be of sufficient interest to
keep them awake.</p><p>And the only penalty of the club was that if the story was not of
sufficient interest to keep the audience awake, the offending member
should pay a sum of ten pounds to a deserving charity.</p><p>No rule was deemed necessary as to the quality of the dinner: the
members had elected themselves with discretion.</p></section><footer/></body></html>
